# trellis — deterministic TypeScript and Python sloppiness audit

---

## 1. What trellis is

trellis is a **deterministic, offline-by-default sloppiness audit** for
TypeScript/TSX and Python workspaces. It parses source with the TypeScript
compiler API or a pinned in-process Python grammar and measures structural
debt — complexity, structural erosion, duplication,
and import cycles — plus a separate, non-scoring inspection of safeguard
configuration (hooks and check wiring). It emits a versioned report with a
**0–100 sloppiness index where lower is better**, raw metrics, score
contributions, ranked hotspots, and safeguard evidence.

Three invariants define the product:

1. **No-model execution.** No audit path — CLI, SDK, fleet, or CI — spawns an
   agent, calls a model, or consumes model-derived grading. There is no
   provider, prompt, or model configuration anywhere in the shipped surface.
   This is an invariant, not a default: a change that introduces one is a
   product bug. Optional analysis providers (§16, contracted) are
   deterministic local tools — never models or agents — and this invariant
   covers them without exception.
2. **Offline and zero-footprint by default.** The first audit of a repo
   requires **neither Git nor credentials, a database, network access, or
   installed project dependencies**. It reads files as they exist on disk
   (dirty worktrees included), never runs the target's scripts or installs
   its packages, and writes nothing unless the operator explicitly requests
   an output file, a baseline, or history persistence. Optional providers
   (§16, contracted) are explicit opt-in only: enabling one never relaxes
   these rules for the native audit, and the provider run itself stays
   offline, never writes to the target, and never acquires tools at audit
   time (§16.4).
3. **One core, every surface.** Local CLI runs, the programmatic SDK, fleet
   orchestration, and CI usage all exercise the same deterministic core with
   the same measurement, scoring, and policy code path. Parity is mechanical
   (deep-equal tests), not aspirational.

trellis answers one question: *how sloppy is this source tree, where
exactly, and is it getting worse?* It does not grade documentation or process, and it does not execute or verify the project's own
checks.

## 2. Goals & non-goals

### Release scope (goals)

- **Metric catalog (initial, §5):**
  - **Complexity** — per-function cyclomatic complexity, maximum nesting,
    source size, and distributions.
  - **Structural erosion** — weighted function mass and the share of mass in
    high-complexity functions.
  - **Duplication** — clone groups, unique affected lines, and density, under
    a bounded, deterministic feasibility decision.
  - **Import cycles** — complete cyclic module groups over a workspace-aware
    resolved dependency graph.
  - **Basic hook/check inspection (safeguards)** — configuration evidence for
    Git hooks, agent hooks, lint/typecheck/test scripts, and quality budgets,
    reported **separately** from the score (§5.5).
- **Versioned contracts** for measurements, findings, and audit
  configuration, with explicit analysis states (§6).
- **A provisional, versioned sloppiness formula** with traceable
  contributions (§7).
- **Baseline comparison and failure policies** over saved report artifacts,
  with the 0/1/2 exit-code convention (§9).
- **Optional history** in SQLite (§10); **optional fleet** aggregation and the pre-existing
  canonical-standards drift capability as independent consumers (§11).
- **CLI and SDK parity** over the single core (§12).

### Non-goals (explicitly deferred)

- **Unused-code analysis** (dead exports, unreachable modules, orphan files)
  as a native, scored capability — optional advisory reachability evidence
  from a provider is contracted in §16.
- **Broader architecture rules** (layering constraints, boundary enforcement,
  dependency-direction policies beyond cycle detection) — optional advisory
  evidence for declared rules is contracted in §16; native enforcement stays
  deferred.
- **Project verification execution** — running the target's tests, builds,
  linters, or hooks. trellis inspects their *configuration*; it never
  executes them and never claims they pass.
- **AI features** of any kind — no model calls, agent passes, embeddings, or
  LLM-assisted grading, per the §1 invariant.
- **Additional language adapters** beyond TypeScript/TSX and Python. Other
  languages are reported as unsupported coverage (§3.3), never analyzed.
- Also deferred: a web UI, automatic remediation / fix fan-out, hosted or
  scheduled services, README badges, and any rewrite in another language.

## 3. Core concepts

### 3.1 Source inventory & classification

Before measurement, trellis discovers the workspace's TS/TSX files and
assigns each to exactly one **source set**: `production`, `test`,
`generated`, `vendored`, or `declaration-only`. Ownership comes from package
manifests and workspace declarations (nested packages are never
double-counted), with documented defaults and explicit per-repo overrides in
the audit configuration (§6.5). Discovery works on uncommitted files and
non-Git directories, and never installs packages, runs repository scripts,
or touches the network.

Only `production` and `test` sets are scored, and they are scored
**separately** — test code never offsets production debt. `generated`,
`vendored`, and excluded scopes are reported as coverage, not counted as
clean.

### 3.2 Metrics, findings, and safeguards

- A **metric** is a deterministic numeric measurement with a unit and, where
  meaningful, a numerator/denominator pair (e.g. duplicated lines / analyzed
  lines). Raw metrics are reported separately from their score
  contributions.
- A **finding** is a located piece of evidence: a repo-relative path and a
  line range, plus a stable kind (hotspot function, clone group, cycle
  group, broken hook reference, …). Findings are ordered deterministically
  and are stable across filesystem enumeration order.
- A **safeguard result** is configuration evidence about a hook or check
  (§5.5). Safeguards are **not** metrics and contribute **nothing** to the
  sloppiness index.

### 3.3 Analysis states & unsupported-language coverage

Every measurement and every report carries an explicit state:

- `complete` — the measurement ran over its full intended scope.
- `incomplete` — part of the scored scope could not be analyzed (parse errors,
  unresolved imports that could join scored source nodes, resource exhaustion).
  Python imports with runtime-selected or absent targets remain located
  observations outside the declared-source cycle score. A test-only parse
  failure may make overall evidence incomplete while leaving a complete
  production score. The report says what and where;
  an incomplete required dimension prevents publishing an apparently
  complete headline score (§7).
- `unsupported` — the source is outside the TypeScript/TSX/Python analyzed
  language set. Unsupported surface is **coverage**, never cleanliness: a
  repository with unrecognized languages does not get a clean bill for them.
- `not-applicable` — the measurement is genuinely meaningless for the scope
  (e.g. complexity of a function-free declaration-only package). Documented
  per metric; never used to hide an analysis failure.

Test coverage (how much *test* source exists) and analysis completeness (how
much of the intended scope was actually measured) are distinct fields and are
never conflated.

Two further states apply to optional provider analyses (§16.2, contract —
plan `pl-43c5`): `unrequested` (not enabled for this run; no evidence and
no invented metrics) and `unavailable` (enabled but could not run —
missing or malformed pinned tool, exhausted execution limits; located, with
a reason, never a silent clean result). Provider states never roll into
the native completeness rollup above: overall evidence completeness and
score completeness are independent quantities (§16.2).

### 3.4 The sloppiness index

The headline number is a **0–100 index where lower is better**, produced by
the provisional formula in §7.

- **It is not a percentage of bad code.** It is a weighted, normalized
  composite of structural signals; 40 does not mean "40% of the code is
  bad." Renderers must always display the direction ("lower is better") and
  the scoring version alongside the number, and must never present it as a
  percentage of anything.
- **Infrastructure cannot offset it.** Safeguards, CI wiring, hooks, test
  volume, and process artifacts contribute nothing to the index. A repo with
  perfect tooling and sloppy code scores sloppy; the safeguard report is
  where the tooling shows up. Likewise, test-source measurements are
  reported separately and never dilute production debt.
- **Counts and densities are both retained.** Large clean additions cannot
  erase hotspot findings: absolute counts (e.g. number of functions over the
  complexity threshold) and normalized densities are reported side by side,
  and findings persist regardless of ratio movement.
- **Missing required dimensions block the headline.** If a required metric is
  `incomplete`, the report says so and the index is either withheld or
  published explicitly flagged as partial — never silently complete-looking.

### 3.5 Versioning

Three versions travel with every report:

- **Analyzer version** — the trellis release that produced the measurements.
- **Scoring version** — the formula version (§7). The initial formula is
  **provisional** pending calibration against the fixed corpus (§14); any
  recalibration bumps the scoring version and its test expectations
  together.
- **Schema version** — the report/configuration contract version (§6).

Comparability rule: two reports are trend-comparable only when analyzer,
scoring, and configuration semantics are compatible; incompatible
comparisons are reported explicitly rather than silently computed (§9).

The scoped hotspot identity transition and exact version changes are specified
in [`docs/hotspot-identity.md`](docs/hotspot-identity.md). Scoring is unchanged.

**Deterministic payload.** The measurement payload excludes timestamps,
durations, and machine identifiers from equality and fingerprint inputs:
same files + same configuration + same analyzer/scoring versions ⇒ equal
measurement payload. Timings may be recorded as metadata but never
participate in identity.

---

## 4. Architecture

Deterministic module layout:

```
trellis/
├─ src/
│  ├─ cli/                 # THIN commander entrypoints; delegate to core (§13.1)
│  ├─ client/              # typed SDK over the core; mirrors core types
│  ├─ config/              # declarative audit configuration: load + validate
│  ├─ discovery/           # TS/TSX source discovery → classified workspace inventory
│  ├─ syntax/              # shared parse layer (pinned TS compiler API) + function inventory
│  ├─ metrics/             # complexity, erosion, duplication, import cycles
│  ├─ safeguards/          # hook/check configuration inspection (non-scoring)
│  ├─ scoring/             # provisional sloppiness formula (pure)
│  ├─ report/              # report assembly + terminal / JSON / markdown renderers
│  ├─ compare/             # baseline comparison + failure policies
│  ├─ store/               # OPTIONAL SQLite history (opt-in audit history)
│  ├─ fleet/               # OPTIONAL targets orchestration over the same core
│  ├─ standards/           # canonical-config drift (separate capability, §11)
│  └─ index.ts             # public lib entry — VERSION constant only
└─ ...
```

The pipeline is one-directional:

```
discover → parse (shared inventory) → measure (metrics + safeguards)
        → score (pure, provisional formula) → assemble report
        → [render] [compare vs baseline + policy] [persist, if asked]
```

Persistence and policy evaluation live **outside** the measurement pass; a
measurement never touches the database or the network.

The **api>cli>sdk discipline** (§13.1) is unchanged: all behavior in core
modules; `src/cli/` and `src/client/` are thin pass-throughs exercising one
code path.

## 5. The metric catalog (release scope)

### 5.1 Complexity

Per-function measurements over the shared syntax inventory:

- **Cyclomatic complexity (CC)** per function, with an exact, documented
  definition of which AST decisions count: `if`/`else if`, `for`/`for-in`/
  `for-of`/`while`/`do`, `case` clauses, `catch`, logical operators
  (`&&`/`||`/`??`), conditional expressions, and optional chaining. Nested
  functions are attributed to themselves, never folded into the parent's
  branch totals; overload signatures are not bodies.
- **Maximum nesting depth** per function.
- **Source size** per function and per file (SLOC, with documented handling
  of multiline literals and comment-only lines).
- **Distributions** per package and repo (e.g. p50/p90/max CC), plus ranked
  **hotspots** with exact relative paths and line ranges.

Size and nesting are explanatory signals unless the scoring formula
explicitly includes them (§7). Empty or function-free scopes produce
documented finite values or `not-applicable`, never crashes or silent zeros.

An unscored `trellis.executable-scopes` pass separately inventories module,
class-initialization and function bodies. It assigns decisions in defaults,
decorators and class headers to the enclosing unit and resets ownership and
control depth inside each nested function body. Located
`executable.initialization` findings show module/class decisions;
`executable.nesting` findings begin at control depth 3 independently of the
scored CC 11 hotspot threshold. The pass retains stable named owner keys,
marks ambiguous owners explicitly and never feeds the scoring formula. Its
depth conventions and metric definitions are in
[`docs/executable-scopes.md`](docs/executable-scopes.md).

Terminal and Markdown reports expose production absolute burden alongside
density and its observed denominator, current formula saturation, production
graph scope versus workspace observations, unsupported files and separate
advisory documentation review. Comparable report diffs carry exact dimension
point changes, denominator changes, persistent-finding severity changes and
native source-snapshot status in structured JSON; renderers use those core
facts. See [`docs/report-interpretation.md`](docs/report-interpretation.md).

Analyzer 0.9.0 identifies only first-statement Python string expressions in
module, class and function suites as docstrings. Physical code-line counts
remain in source coverage and `complexity.functions.*.detail.sloc`;
`complexity.executable-sloc.*` counts structural lines after those docstrings
are omitted. Each function's hotspot facts carry both executable `sloc` and
`physicalSloc`. Ordinary multiline runtime strings remain code. Python
function mass uses executable SLOC; documentation-only edits can move source
ranges and physical counts without changing structural mass. TypeScript
comment handling is unchanged.

Python analyzer 0.7.0 excludes confirmed `typing.overload` declarations from
executable function mass, associates them with the following same-container
implementation and retains orphan declarations as located, unscored
`python.orphan-overload` findings. Rebound decorators do not imply overloads;
conditional same-named implementations remain distinct ambiguous identities.
This scored population change is scoring 0.7.0-provisional, with the same
formula weights and a required fresh baseline.

### 5.2 Structural erosion

Erosion weights complexity by size so a huge tangled function outranks a tiny
tangled one:

- **Function mass** = `CC × sqrt(SLOC)`.
- For Python, this SLOC is executable structural size after first-statement
  docstrings are omitted; the physical size remains separately visible above.
- **Eroded mass share** = the share of total mass belonging to functions with
  `CC > 10`.
- Aggregation from functions → packages → repo uses **summed masses**, never
  averages of package percentages (a big package's erosion must not be
  diluted by averaging it against tiny ones).

### 5.3 Duplication

Clone detection over the shared inventory, under a **bounded, deterministic
feasibility decision**: before running, trellis decides from corpus size
whether the analysis fits declared time/memory budgets; if not, the metric is
`incomplete` with the reason — resource limits never silently return a clean
result.

- **Clone groups**: stable group identifiers, member ranges, and copy counts;
  deterministic ordering independent of filesystem enumeration.
- **Unique affected lines**: the numerator counts the *union* of duplicated
  source lines once (overlapping clones are not double-counted), over a
  documented compatible denominator, yielding a duplication **density**.
- **Scope discipline**: no clones cross excluded/generated scopes;
  test-to-production matches follow the documented contract (test and
  production duplication are reported separately).

**Decision (trellis-5a91, 2026-09-16): a small normalized-token
detector over the shared parse, built and owned by trellis.** The evaluation
compared a spike of this approach against the two embeddable forms of the
existing deterministic analyzer jscpd — 4.3.0 (JS library API) and 5.2.1
(Rust engine, prebuilt platform binaries) — on fixed local fixtures and two
declared corpora (record below). Both jscpd forms were rejected: 5.2.1
embeds only as a subprocess around an opaque platform binary (8
optionalDependency platform packages), reports clone *pairs* rather than
groups, is type-1 only by default, runs threaded with a timestamped payload,
and auto-discovers config from scanned ancestors — an external process
boundary inside the measurement path, against the §8 “local parsing and
arithmetic” invariant. 4.3.0 is the unmaintained JS line: it fails to import
under Bun (reproduced: `colors` CJS/ESM interop), pulls 118 transitive
packages (~20 MB), is type-1 only, and stamps `foundDate` into clone
payloads. The own implementation adds **zero runtime dependencies** (the
pinned `typescript` is already ours), reuses the one shared parse (§13), and
is the only candidate that natively provides the required semantics below —
clone groups, overlap-union line accounting, per-source-set separation, and
budget-exhaustion `incomplete` states.

Semantics fixed by this decision:

- **Token stream**: the leaf tokens of the shared `ts.SourceFile` in document
  order (comments and trivia never appear). A raw scanner loop is not used:
  it mis-tokenizes template literals without manual re-scan state
  (reproduced); the AST walk is correct by construction and needs no second
  parse.
- **Exact/normalized semantics**: every identifier maps to one placeholder
  and every literal (string, numeric, bigint, regex, template part) maps to
  one placeholder; all other tokens contribute their `SyntaxKind`. This
  detects exact (type-1) and identifier/literal-renamed (type-2) clones.
  Near clones (type-3) are **out of scope**: a divergence splits a match into
  maximal exact-normalized runs, each reported independently if above the
  minimum size. (jscpd 5’s `--similarity` AST mode is the noted direction if
  type-3 is ever revisited.)
- **Minimum clone size** (calibrated by the corpus stage, trellis-e924 —
  see `docs/corpus-validation.md`: at 50 tokens the corpus and the trellis
  self-audit were dominated by idiomatic-structure matches; at 100 the
  surviving groups are true copy-paste): **100 normalized tokens and 3
  lines**, both required.
- **Grouping**: a clone group is the set of ranges sharing one identical
  normalized token sequence (content identity), with at least two members
  after dropping same-file token-contained members; there is no transitive
  pairwise merging. Within-file repeats count as clones.
- **Ranges** are token-exact maximal runs; a reported line range may include
  a partial boundary line (both jscpd engines exhibit the same overhang).
- **Line-overlap review context** (trellis-8a72): native clone findings add
  `facts.lineOverlap = { version: 1, overlaps, memberIndexes, spans }`.
  Zero-based indexes identify affected entries in the existing `facts.members`
  array; spans are the sorted union of inclusive `{ path, startLine, endLine }`
  ranges covered by at least two members of this group in the same file.
  Production/test groups remain separate. This is line overlap, not proof of
  token overlap, semantic duplication, or a safe extraction opportunity.
  The additive, independently versioned facts extension fits schema 1.2.0's
  existing open facts map; no report, analyzer, or scoring version changes.
  Older 1.0.0/1.1.0/1.2.0 artifacts remain readable; missing or unrecognized
  overlap metadata means unknown, never false. It does not participate in
  finding identity, metrics, scoring or comparison compatibility. Evidence
  describes only emitted members: parse-incomplete scopes stay incomplete;
  exhausted scopes emit no groups and make no overlap claim.
- **Overlap union**: the numerator is the union of code-classified lines
  (§5.1 line rules) covered by any member range, counted once per file —
  overlapping or nested groups never double-count; the denominator is the
  scope’s total code-classified lines, making the density a ratio of
  compatible quantities.
  From analyzer 0.9.0 onward, Python's numerator and denominator both use
  executable code lines after actual first-statement docstrings are omitted;
  the token population omits those same docstrings. Original source ranges
  remain attached to clone members. TypeScript's population is unchanged.
- **Advisory executable-copy candidate (P2.2)**: native raw normalized groups
  above remain the scored authority. A separate `duplication.candidate.*`
  metric family and added clone finding facts classify each occurrence by AST
  role: executable logic, import/export list, type declaration, literal data,
  or mixed/unknown. Entirely literal argument calls are data context; mixed
  executable/data spans are classified conservatively. Within each raw group,
  a deterministic earliest-finish interval selection counts the maximum
  number of non-overlapping token occurrences per file. Shared physical lines
  do not make disjoint token intervals overlap; a self-shifted list with only
  one independent occurrence is not a copy claim. At least two independent
  executable occurrences are required for candidate burden. The candidate
  density numerator is the union of eligible executable lines covered by
  those selected occurrences; its denominator is the same eligible-line
  population across the source set. Candidate counts and density never enter
  the current formula.
- **Normalization comparisons (P2.2)**: postfilters on those same raw groups
  report whether independent members preserve original token kinds, the
  equality pattern of identifiers/literals, exact source token text (so
  identical data copies differ from merely similar tables), and complete
  statement boundaries. These are research evidence, not additional default
  findings or a new detector. The context and boundaries are static syntax
  classifications, not proof of a safe extraction or of unnecessary data.
  Advisory candidate work has a separate bounded pass; its exhaustion marks
  only candidate metrics incomplete and leaves committed raw groups, raw
  density and the scored index intact. Parse diagnostics still mark both
  populations partial.
- **Production/test boundary**: detection runs **per source set** — token
  streams are never matched across sets, so production and test duplication
  are measured separately (§3.1); `generated`, `vendored`,
  `declaration-only`, and excluded files are never tokenized.
- **Bounded feasibility (work accounting v2, analyzer 0.2.3)**: collection,
  indexing, extraction, materialization, containment and line accounting share
  deterministic guards. Per source set: **2,000,000 normalized tokens**,
  **250,000,000 work units**, 100,000 streams, 32,000,000 numeric scratch cells,
  200,000 retained groups and 1,000,000 retained member occurrences. Existing
  `maxTokens`/`maxMatchWork` callers may lower the two limits; non-finite,
  fractional, negative or above-ceiling values are operational errors. The
  token limit is checked during collection and before combined allocation.
  Every stopped pass is `incomplete`, with its phase/cap and no uncommitted
  metric value or group presented as measured zero. Shared parsing precedes
  the detector and is not claimed to fit its scratch limit.

**Delivered bounded engine (pl-da6d, trellis-e55c):** original SA-IS induced
suffix sorting, Kasai LCP and maximal-context interval extraction replace the
quadratic window-pair runtime. The old engine remains only as a bounded test
reference. No public engine selector, subprocess, dependency, model, download,
scoring recalibration or target write is added. The thresholds, token stream,
source-set separation, clone membership/IDs and code-line union remain unchanged.
[The contract](docs/research/native-duplication/README.md) freezes semantics and
resources; [executed acceptance](docs/research/native-duplication/acceptance.md)
covers fourteen fingerprinted corpus entries plus 2/10/40-copy controls.
Work v2 counts the whole pipeline rather than historical extension comparisons;
analyzer/native tool+adapter 0.2.3 and recorded analysis options distinguish the
  semantics. At that cutover, report schema stayed 1.2.0 and scoring stayed 0.2.0-provisional. Older
artifacts remain readable; crossing analyzer/resource semantics requires a fresh
baseline. Formerly complete metrics/scores retain parity; newly complete
measurements are improved observability, not source cleanup.
[Combined release acceptance](docs/scoped-identity-duplication-acceptance.md) maps
all eleven plan steps to executed identity, corpus, surface and offline checks.

Historical Evaluation record (evidence; directional measurements, not benchmarks):

- **Fixtures**: six hand-authored TS cases with known outcomes — exact copy,
  identifier/literal rename, overlapping multi-file regions, four-way
  multi-copy, below-threshold idiom, and a near clone with two changed
  lines. At 50 tokens the spike produced exactly the semantics above (the
  renamed clone detected; the below-threshold idiom silent; the near clone
  reported as its maximal shared run). Both jscpd engines matched the
  type-1 outcomes but missed the renamed clone entirely (jscpd 5 finds it
  only in `--similarity` mode).
- **Corpora**: C1 = trellis `src/` @ `853348b` (185 TS files including
  tests; 22,854 physical lines, 19,847 token-covered code lines, 131,994
  leaf tokens). C2 = C1 replicated 4× (740 files, 91,416 physical lines) as
  a deterministic high-multiplicity stress corpus.
- **Environment**: Linux x86_64 container (kernel 6.12), 2 vCPU Intel Xeon
  @ 2.20 GHz, 32 GB RAM; Bun 1.2.23; Node 22.23.2; typescript 6.0.3; jscpd
  4.3.0 / 5.2.1 from npm. Timings are median wall ms of 3 runs (1 run for
  C2 spike/jscpd-4), process startup included; memory is peak RSS (VmHWM).

| engine | C1 @ 50 tok | C1 @ 100 tok | C2 @ 50 tok |
|---|---|---|---|
| spike (naive, Bun) | 9.1 s / 360 MB | 7.5 s / 338 MB | 70.5 s / 493 MB |
| jscpd 4.3.0 API (Node) | 11.3 s / 180 MB | — | 26.5 s / 303 MB |
| jscpd 5.2.1 CLI (Rust) | 0.9 s / 47 MB | ~0.9 s / 47 MB | 1.6 s / 47 MB |

- **Recall comparison** at 100 tokens on C1: spike 506 content groups /
  2,909 union lines (14.7% of code lines) vs. jscpd 5: 13 pairs / 270 lines
  (1.2%). Spot-checks confirmed the spike’s extra recall is dominated by
  true renamed copy-paste (e.g. the `runCli` test helper cloned across four
  test files) that exact-token engines cannot see, plus idiomatic-structure
  matches that threshold calibration (trellis-e924) must control.
- **Limitations**: the spike is deliberately naive (per-bucket pairwise
  extension) — its numbers are a floor, and known optimizations (window
  index built once, occurrence-deduped buckets, capped bucket enumeration)
  precede the budget guard; even so, naive cost at real-repo scale is in
  the same class as the mature JS engine. Type-3 near clones are deferred.
  Timings come from one container on one day; they justify feasibility, not
  speed claims.

**Revision (trellis-06f8, plan `pl-43c5`, 2026-09-17):** the decision above
stands unchanged for the **native default engine and scoring basis** — no
jscpd form replaces the trellis detector or feeds the score. Its blanket
restriction reading — no subprocess engine may ever run in any analysis
slot — is explicitly narrowed by the optional-provider contract (§16):
pinned jscpd 5.2.1 may run as a **supplemental, unscored** duplication
evidence provider under the controlled execution boundary (§16.4). Spike
2 ([`docs/research/provider-spike.md`](docs/research/provider-spike.md))
showed the 5.2.1 binary supports `--ignore-identifiers`,
`--ignore-literals`, `--max-gap-lines` and `--similarity`, which the
type-1-only assessment above did not reflect. Native clone groups and
overlap-union line accounting remain authoritative (§16.5); a provider
backend promotion or provider-derived weight would require its own
versioned calibration (§16.5).

### 5.4 Import cycles

- **Graph construction**: imports are taken from the AST (comments and string
  contents cannot forge imports) and resolved with TypeScript resolution
  appropriate to tsconfig aliases and local workspace packages. Re-exports,
  literal dynamic imports, and unresolved imports are recorded; external
  packages are distinguishable from unresolved *local* edges, and unresolved
  coverage accompanies the results. Resolution uses local files and
  configuration only — absent `node_modules` degrades to documented
  unresolved edges, never to a network fetch.
  *(Landed, trellis-d214: `src/metrics/graph-*.ts` + `analyze-graph.ts`.
  The governing tsconfig is the nearest `tsconfig.json` walking up from the
  importing file; undeclared `moduleResolution` defaults to `bundler`, and
  `paths` without `baseUrl` resolve against the config's directory.
  Workspace packages resolve by manifest name through `exports` (string or
  one condition level, `import`→`require`→`default`→`types`, single `*`
  wildcard; an `exports`-bearing package encapsulates unlisted subpaths),
  then `main`, `types`, `index`. Externals are recorded by name and never
  resolved into — `node_modules` is never consulted, so absent dependencies
  change nothing; workspace entries pointing at absent build outputs surface
  as documented `unresolved` edges. Resolution targets outside the
  classified scope are `out-of-scope` edges, not nodes.)*
- **Edges are typed**: runtime vs. type-only edges retain their identity;
  whether they are scored separately is fixed by the (versioned) graph
  policy. *(Landed, trellis-d214: `GRAPH_POLICY` version `1.2.0` in
  `src/metrics/graph-types.ts` — type-only edges retained-distinct,
  literal-only dynamic imports, self-edges retained, externals
  recorded-never-resolved.)*
- **Cycle measurement**: strongly connected components expose **complete
  cyclic module groups** (not first-cycle-only), with affected-module
  density and representative paths. Group identifiers and representative
  paths are stable across enumeration order. Package and repo views preserve
  cross-package cycles without double-counting. Disjoint, overlapping,
  acyclic, and self-import cases have specified, tested outcomes.
  *(Landed, trellis-cbde: `src/metrics/cycles.ts` + `analyze-cycles.ts`
  under `CYCLE_POLICY` version `1.1.0`. Runtime and type-only edges form
  two separate subgraphs — a pair linked runtime one way and type-only the
  other is not a cycle in either — and the two classes are **scored
  separately**; a group cyclic in both appears once per class. A retained
  self-edge is a size-1 group with representative path `[p, p]`. Ids
  `cycle-<n>` follow (smallest member, class) order; the representative
  path is the shortest cycle from the smallest member over sorted
  adjacency. Cross-package groups keep one id across per-package views
  while module counts stay per-package, so the repo-level affected-module
  union never double-counts. Emits `import-cycle.groups` /
  `import-cycle.modules` / `import-cycle.density` and one located
  `import-cycle` finding per group; incomplete scored graph coverage (unresolved
  edges that could join declared nodes, parse diagnostics) rolls every cycle
  metric up `incomplete` with
  the graph's reasons and a machine-readable `unresolvedEdges` count.)*

  Python runtime-selected imports and imports with no discovered target remain
  located unresolved findings and counts. They do not make the cycle metric
  incomplete because the scored graph is limited to declared source targets.
  Ambiguous owners remain blocking unknown edges. TypeScript unresolved local
  intent remains blocking. This scope change is graph policy 1.2.0 and scoring
  version 0.4.0-provisional; older baselines require a fresh comparison.

  Starting with analyzer 0.5.0, graph policy 1.3.0 and cycle policy 1.2.0,
  `import-cycle.{groups,modules,density}.production` measure the graph induced
  by production files and only imports between those files. The scoring
  formula consumes `groups.production` and `density.production`; the original
  unsuffixed metrics retain their workspace-wide meaning as unscored evidence.
  Production-cycle completeness derives from production parse diagnostics and
  unresolved production imports, independently of test-only failures. A
  production import of a test module is a located
  `graph.production-imports-test` finding. Workspace cycle findings carry
  their source sets and whether all members are in the scored graph. This
  measurement correction is scoring 0.5.0-provisional and requires a fresh
  baseline; formula weights are unchanged.

  Analyzer 0.6.0 and graph policy 1.4.0 classify confirmed Python
  `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` guards as type-only edges, including imported and
  qualified aliases, nested guards and provable negation. Rebound or shadowed
  bindings are not inferred to be type-only. Runtime and type-only cycle
  groups remain separate. This changes scored measurements in some Python
  workspaces, so scoring 0.6.0-provisional requires another fresh baseline;
  formula weights remain unchanged. `.pyi` is not included.

  Analyzer 0.8.0 and graph policy 1.5.0 resolve binding-confirmed Python
  `importlib.import_module` calls with plain literal module names, including
  literal relative names with a literal `package` argument. A one-argument,
  absolute, literal `__import__` is also supported; its other argument forms
  remain unresolved because its return and import semantics differ. Rebound
  aliases, variable arguments and ambiguous source-root ownership never
  fabricate a local edge. Python graph edges carry `typeOnly`, `deferred` and
  `conditional` context without excluding architectural dependencies from
  cycle measurement. `graph.observation.dynamic.{resolved,unresolved}` metrics
  are split by production/test and count only recognized Python dynamic calls;
  they do not claim full runtime-graph coverage. The unresolved production
  metric is eligible for a declarative `policy.budgets` maximum, including
  zero. A runtime-selected import stays located and does not withhold the
  declared-static-scope cycle score; a production parse failure or ambiguous
  local owner still withholds the scored cycle dimension. Scoring
  0.8.0-provisional changes measurements for provable literal calls, retains
  the existing formula weights, and requires a fresh compatible baseline.

### 5.5 Safeguards (hook/check inspection — separate from the score)

Safeguards inspect **configuration**, never execution, over a small
documented set of supported formats:

- Git pre-commit hooks; supported agent hook surfaces.
- lint / typecheck / test scripts in package manifests, including custom
  named scripts recognized through supported wiring (not named-tool presence
  alone).
- Coverage / file-size / duplication budgets and references to the checks
  that enforce them.

Each safeguard is reported at one of four **evidence levels**:

| level | meaning |
|---|---|
| `absent` | no configuration surface found |
| `configured` | configuration exists |
| `structurally-wired` | configuration is verifiably connected to an enforcement point (e.g. a CI step invoking the check script) |
| `unknown` | the surface uses unsupported constructs (arbitrary shell, executable config) — explicitly unverified |

Rules:

- **Passing execution is never inferred.** trellis reports that a check is
  wired, not that it succeeds.
- Broken local hook/check references produce **located findings** (path +
  range).
- Unsupported shell constructs or executable configuration remain
  `unknown` — never guessed.
- **No score credit.** Safeguard results do not enter the sloppiness index in
  either direction, and no use of seeds/mulch/canopy or the presence of
  agent-instruction files grants any structural credit.

## 6. Data shapes (versioned contracts)

All contracts are zod-validated at every boundary and carry the §3.5 schema
version. Schemas reject invalid ranges, non-finite numbers, missing required
version data, and misleading `complete` states.

### 6.1 Metric value

```jsonc
{
  "id": "duplication.density",
  "state": "complete",              // complete | incomplete | unsupported | not-applicable
  "value": 0.031,                   // finite number, unit per metric catalog
  "unit": "ratio",
  "numerator": 412,                 // optional raw pair (unique duplicated lines)
  "denominator": 13280,             //   (analyzed lines)
  "detail": { /* per-metric extras: distributions, group counts, ... */ }
}
```

### 6.2 Finding

```jsonc
{
  "kind": "complexity.hotspot",     // stable, versioned kind
  "path": "src/audit/audit.ts",    // repo-relative
  "range": { "start": { "line": 41 }, "end": { "line": 128 } },
  "summary": "CC 23, mass 214",
  "facts": { "cc": 23, "mass": 214 }
}
```

Scoped native hotspot identity v1 is defined in
[`docs/hotspot-identity.md`](docs/hotspot-identity.md), including the function-form
and historical compatibility matrices. Schemas 1.2.0 and 1.3.0 require identified or
explicitly ambiguous provenance on native hotspots. Analyzer 0.2.2 derives
that provenance from the shared AST; historical 1.0.0/1.1.0 artifacts retain
their original interpretation.

### 6.3 Safeguard result

```jsonc
{
  "id": "pre-commit-hook",
  "evidence": "structurally-wired", // absent | configured | structurally-wired | unknown
  "locations": [ { "path": "scripts/hooks/pre-commit" } ],
  "notes": "invoked via core.hooksPath; check:all referenced from CI"
}
```

### 6.4 Report

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.5.0",
  "analyzerVersion": "0.2.0",
  "scoringVersion": "0.1.0-provisional",
  "repo": { "root": "/abs/path", "identity": "…" },
  "sourceCoverage": {
    "production": { "files": 210, "sloc": 13280 },
    "test": { "files": 96, "sloc": 5100 },
    "generated": { "files": 4 },
    "unsupported": { "files": 30, "note": "non-TS sources, not analyzed" }
  },
  "completeness": "complete",       // rolled up from metric states
  "metrics": { /* §6.1 by id, raw values separate from contributions */ },
  "score": {
    "index": 27,                    // 0–100, LOWER IS BETTER — not a percentage; null when withheld
    "direction": "lower-is-better",
    "partial": false,               // true with a withheld headline when a required dimension is incomplete
    "unknownDimensions": [],        // required native dimensions without complete analysis
    "contributions": [ /* per-dimension points, traceable to raw metrics */ ]
  },
  "findings": [ /* §6.2, deterministically ordered */ ],
  "safeguards": [ /* §6.3 — separate; never folded into score */ ]
}
```

The deterministic measurement payload (everything except run metadata such
as `auditedAt` and durations) is equality-stable per §3.5.

### 6.5 Audit configuration (declarative)

Per-repo configuration is data, not code — **no executable hooks**:

```yaml
# trellis.yaml (optional; sensible defaults without it)

  exclude: ["src/generated/**"]        # additions to documented defaults
  classify:
    "scripts/tools/**": "test"          # explicit source-set overrides

      - kind: cycle                   #   cycle and unresolved checks are rules too —
        name: no-runtime-cycles        #   runtime and type-only cycle policies stay distinct
        edges: [runtime]
  knip:                                #   declared reachability context (trellis-5da5) — explicit
    entries: [src/cli/main.ts]         #   application/script entries, exported public surfaces

    tests: excluded                    #   absent key records undefined reachability, never dead code

    maxIncrease: 2                      # absolute tolerance, in index points
    maxIncreasePercent: 10              # relative tolerance, % of the baseline index
  budgets:
    duplication.density: { max: 0.05 }

  requireEvidence: [jscpd]              # demanded provider evidence (§16.3): absent or
                                         #   failed evidence fails the run, never the score
```

The native `documentation.excessive` finding reviews first-statement Python
module/class/function docstrings and attached TypeScript/TSX JSDoc only. It
counts nonblank physical content lines and Unicode-whitespace-separated words
after removing literal/comment delimiters and JSDoc line stars; examples and
code blocks count. A block is flagged when either count exceeds its threshold
(equality passes). Findings include source range, owner identity when known,
source set, counts and effective thresholds. The default is advisory and
unscored; operators can add `documentation.excessive` to `policy.failOnNew`.
Changing detector settings makes documentation deltas noncomparable without
invalidating the scored index comparison. A warning calls for review of
repetition or a maintained reference document while retaining essential API
contracts and examples; size alone does not prove a block unnecessary.

Provider selection (§16.4, `providers`) is declarative data with the same
rules: the block names exactly the known optional providers (an unknown id
is invalid configuration), a delivered provider resolves per run, and a
requested-but-undelivered or gated capability (SonarJS, §16.7) resolves to
located `unsupported` evidence. Selection never mutates scoring (§16.5): a
requested provider adds namespaced advisory evidence alongside the native
duplication result and changes neither the native measurement nor the
score; the default audit (no block) requests nothing, stages nothing and
launches nothing.

Architecture rules (`providers.dependency-cruiser.rules`, trellis-89be)
are the bounded declarative dependency-rule subset — boundary
(allowed/forbidden from/to scope selectors over explicit runtime /
type-only edge kinds), cycle (per edge kind, so type-only and runtime
cycle policies stay distinct) and unresolved rules as inline data.
Unknown rule kinds, executable `.dependency-cruiser` configs, ambiguous
rule sets and invalid patterns are rejected at config-load time; a request
without rules declares no architecture claims — zero rules is never
coherence, and no layering is inferred from directory names. The compiled
policy's normalized digest rides the analysis identity (§16.2), so a
changed declared architecture is a changed measurement — never silently
reported as code churn. The adapter (trellis-adbf) turns compiled rules
into coverage-checked evidence; until it delivers, requests resolve to
located `unsupported` evidence.

Reachability configuration (`providers.knip`, trellis-5da5) records the
declared reachability model any Knip evidence runs under: explicit
application/script `entries`, exported `public` surfaces (optionally
narrowed to one named export) and whether the measured `tests` participate
as reachability roots. Local non-use never means unnecessary code:
omitted entries, unresolvable declarations and missing dependency context
are recorded contextual assumptions — a candidate over an assumed surface
can never be confirmed dead code — and framework/tool plugin discovery is
disabled outright (any future plugin support requires a separately
declared trust boundary, never target configuration or plugin code).
Test files that participate supply reachability evidence while staying
classified test — never scored as production and never diluting a
production denominator — and a barrel re-export is a distinct surface
from the implementation it exposes. The compiled context's normalized
digest rides the analysis identity (§16.2) through the same compatibility
seam as the architecture policy. The delivered adapter (trellis-8ebc) turns
the prepared context into contextual advisory evidence: the pinned Knip
runs through trellis-generated configuration over a staged source view with
every runtime plugin disabled, differentiating orphan files, unused
exports/types and unresolved imports as namespaced candidate findings with
stable path/symbol ordering, and declared public surfaces exempt their own
candidates as visible evidence. Coverage is checked per run: an empty or
partial pass (the tool's configuration-hint signal, staging gaps, suspect
or malformed reports) is located `incomplete` evidence, never a clean pass —
and zero candidates never proves overall quality.

Policy budgets gate the run; they never silently change how the index is
computed (§7). A budget key may also name a provider's namespaced evidence
(`provider.jscpd.pairs`) — evaluated only over that analysis's carried
evidence, never a fabricated zero — and `requireEvidence` lists the optional
provider analyses (§16.1 ids) whose evidence the policy demands: a required
analysis that is unrequested, unavailable, unsupported or incomplete fails
the run closed (§16.3) even when the native score is complete, while an
absent optional provider with no requirement never violates policy and
never changes the score (§16.5).

### 6.6 Provider evidence (contract — §16; lands with plan `pl-43c5`)

When optional providers ship, their observations join the report as an
**additive, namespaced provider-evidence area** — never inside `metrics`,
never as native finding kinds, never inside `score`. Each entry carries
provider identity, analysis identity, observed coverage, one of the §16.2
states, and located findings. The schema-version governance above applies;
older reports without the area remain valid, and its absence reads as
`unrequested` (§16.6), never as a failure.

---

## 7. Scoring — the provisional formula

Scoring is a **pure function** of structural raw metrics. The initial formula
is **provisional** (`scoringVersion: 0.9.0-provisional`) pending calibration
against the fixed corpus (§14); normalization thresholds and weights are
documented in §7.1 (landed with `trellis-00d5`) and recalibrated only with a
scoring-version bump.

Formula rules (fixed now):

- **Dimensions**: complexity/erosion, duplication, import cycles. Overlapping
  signals (complexity, erosion, size) are **grouped** so a repo is not
  penalized multiple times for the same underlying tangle.
- **Normalization**: each dimension normalizes its raw metric against
  documented thresholds into 0–100 points; the index is the documented
  weighted sum, clamped to 0–100 with stable rounding. Lower is better, and
  the function is monotonic: no code change that worsens a raw metric may
  improve the index.
- **Contributions**: every point is traceable — the report lists each
  dimension's contribution alongside the raw metrics and findings that
  produced it.
- **Missing-analysis policy**: a required dimension that is `incomplete`
  blocks or explicitly flags the headline index (§3.4); it is never treated
  as zero debt.
- **Aggregation**: package scores roll up from summed masses/counts, not
  averages of package ratios.
- **No offsets**: safeguards, test code, and infrastructure contribute
  nothing (§3.4). Policy budgets (§6.5) gate pass/fail; they do not mutate
  weights.
- **Providers never score** (contract, §16.5): optional provider observations
  are unscored evidence — the formula consumes native metrics only. Backend
  promotion or provider-derived weights require a separately versioned
  calibration; they are never part of this scoring version.

### 7.1 The provisional constants

*(Landed, trellis-00d5: `src/scoring/formula.ts` pins every constant below
in `SCORING_FORMULA` under `SCORING_VERSION`; `src/scoring/sloppiness.ts`
implements `scoreSloppiness(metrics)` over the contract `MetricValue`s. The
function takes **no configuration input**, so policy budgets can never
mutate the weights — the strict audit-config schema rejects scoring keys
outright.)*

The index scores the **production** source set only; test-set metrics are
reported raw (§3.1) and never offset production debt. Import cycles are
repo-level by construction.

| dimension | weight | terms (raw value ⇒ saturation ⇒ 100) |
|---|---|---|
| `complexity-erosion` | 0.50 | `erosion.eroded-share.production` @ 0.25; `erosion.eroded-count.production` log scale 20 |
| `duplication` | 0.30 | `duplication.density.production` @ 0.15; `duplication.groups.production` log scale 15 |
| `import-cycle` | 0.20 | `import-cycle.density.production` @ 0.10; `import-cycle.groups.production` log scale 5 |

- Density terms normalize linearly: `100 × min(1, value / saturation)`.
  Absolute counts use `b = ln(1 + count / scale)`, then `100 × b / (1 + b)`.
  There is no finite count saturation and no repository-size denominator.
  Each dimension retains a 50/50 count/density blend. Clean additions cannot
  reduce count contributions or erase hotspot weight; unsaturated densities
  can still decrease. The integer headline can round away small changes.
  This is count non-dilution, not an invariant total score under clean additions.
  See [count calibration](docs/count-calibration.md) for evidence and alternatives.
- Grouping complexity, erosion, and size into one `complexity-erosion`
  dimension keeps the same underlying tangle from being penalized multiple
  times.
- `index = clamp(⌊Σ weight × dimension + 0.5⌋, 0, 100)` — round-half-up
  over IEEE-754 doubles, stable across runs and platforms. Each reported
  contribution is the **largest-remainder integer apportionment** of its
  exact weighted points (ties by dimension id), so contributions always sum
  exactly to the index. Every point traces to the raw metric ids, values,
  and thresholds in the dimension's explanation.
- **Missing analysis is never zero debt**: a dimension whose required
  metrics are `incomplete` (or absent) has no normalized score or contribution
  points; the headline `index` is withheld (`null`) and every unknown dimension
  is named (§3.4). An apparently complete score is never published from partial
  analysis. A `not-applicable` ratio with
  complete zero counts is a genuinely empty scope and scores 0; the
  companion count metric independently confirms zero debt.
- **Aggregation**: the formula consumes only summed-mass repo metrics
  (§5.2 numerator/denominator sums). Per-package ratios in metric `detail`
  are explanatory and are never averaged into the index.

---

## 8. Offline, no-model, and zero-footprint invariants

An audit run, end to end:

- **No model.** No agent process, provider SDK, prompt, or API key is
  involved in any code path. There is nothing to configure because there is
  nothing to connect.
- **No network.** All native analysis is local parsing and arithmetic; tool
  acquisition (if any) is a separate preparation step, never part of an
  audit. *(Revised for optional providers by the §16 contract: an
  explicitly enabled provider may run as a controlled local subprocess —
  still no audit-time acquisition, §16.4.)*
- **No Git required.** Dirty worktrees and uncommitted files are analyzed as
  they exist; non-Git directories audit fine. Commit identity, when present,
  is metadata only.
- **No credentials.** Nothing to authenticate against.
- **No database by default.** An audit without explicit persistence flags is
  stateless: it creates no hidden database or report files. History (§10) is
  opt-in.
- **No installed project dependencies.** trellis never runs `install`, never
  executes the target's scripts, and never imports its executable
  configuration. Absent `node_modules` degrades import resolution to
  documented unresolved edges (§5.4).
- **Controlled optional-provider execution** (contract, §16.4 — not yet
  implemented). When a provider is explicitly enabled, its pinned local
  tool may run over an isolated staged source view using trellis-owned
  temporary scratch with owned cleanup; it never writes to the target,
  never accepts executable target configuration or arbitrary command
  strings, and never downloads. The default audit — and the native
  measurement pass of every audit — is exactly as specified above.

---

## 9. Baseline comparison & failure policies

The scoped-hotspot matching contract and historical fallback boundaries are
specified in [`docs/hotspot-identity.md`](docs/hotspot-identity.md). Native
hotspots match only on unique compatible scoped identities; ambiguity never
falls back to historical pairing and never bypasses scored compatibility.
The identity milestone (pl-da6d steps 1–4, trellis-61d7) is verified through
saved reports, declarative policy, CLI/SDK, fleet and SQLite history; the
linked decision record carries the executed control matrix.

- **Artifact comparison**: two saved JSON reports compare directly — no Git,
  no SQLite. Comparison requires compatible analyzer/scoring/configuration/
  source-scope semantics; incompatible pairs are reported explicitly.
- **Finding matching is conservative**: modern native hotspots match by
  scoped identity; historical hotspots and other kinds retain kind + path
  matching with tolerance for line shifts. Ambiguous matches are reported as
  new/resolved pairs rather than silently paired. Reports classify findings
  as new, resolved, or persistent.
- **Tolerances**: absolute vs. relative tolerances are documented per policy
  knob; score regression uses the configured tolerance, not zero.
- **Policies are independent**: metric budgets, score-regression, and
  new-finding policies (e.g. "no new import cycles", "no new hotspots") are
  evaluated independently — a better aggregate index cannot suppress a
  configured cycle or hotspot failure. Policies return structured reasons.
- **Exit codes** (unchanged convention): `0` clean; `2` when a policy trips
  (the report is still emitted to stdout; reasons go to stderr); `1` on
  operational error (the audit could not run). Policy failure and
  operational failure are always distinguishable.
- **Provider failure semantics** (contract, §16.3 — not yet implemented).
  A requested optional provider that cannot run or cannot cover its scope
  becomes located `unavailable`/`incomplete` evidence in the emitted report
  — never fabricated metrics, never a silent clean result. A declarative
  requirement violated by it trips policy (exit `2`); invalid provider
  configuration or inability to run the audit remains operational error
  (exit `1`).

*(Landed, trellis-942c: `src/compare/` — `load.ts` reads a saved JSON report
and re-validates it against the §6.4 contract (no Git, no SQLite; failures
are operational errors, never policy failures). `compare.ts` compares two
validated artifacts: comparability is refused explicitly on schema/analyzer/
scoring version, metric-catalog, or supplied-configuration mismatches, while
unverifiable configuration and changed source scope are reported as caveats;
finding matching uses scoped identities for modern native hotspots and kind +
path for historical hotspots and other kinds, with unlimited line-shift
tolerance inside a 1:1 group. Ambiguous n:m groups remain resolved + new pairs.
`policy.ts` evaluates max-index, metric budgets, score regression (absolute
`maxIncrease` points / relative `maxIncreasePercent` of the baseline index,
each documented per knob), and `failOnNew` kinds independently — each returns
structured coded reasons, a better index cannot suppress a cycle/hotspot
failure, and baseline-dependent policies skip on an absent baseline but fail
closed on an incompatible one. The CLI (`trellis compare`, `--baseline`)
and SDK wiring landed with trellis-9a88.)*

---

## 10. History (optional)

- Persistence is **opt-in** (`--history` / SDK option); the default audit is
  stateless (§8).
- When enabled, runs append to a local SQLite database (`bun:sqlite`,
  append-only migrations). Repository identity avoids accidental collisions
  between unrelated directories that share a basename.
- Trend queries select only compatible runs (§3.5).

---

## 11. Fleet & standards (optional consumers)

- **Fleet** (`targets.yaml`) orchestrates the same core over multiple repos
  and aggregates results; per-repo findings and completeness are preserved,
  and fleet results match independent core audits. Unknown configuration
  keys are rejected. No scheduling
  or hosting is added.
- **Standards / canonical-config drift** remains as a **separate
  capability**: it compares shared tooling files against the bundled
  canonical set exactly as before, and its results **do not contribute to
  the sloppiness index** in either direction. It is not expanded in this
  release.

*(Landed, trellis-8366: `src/fleet/` loads strict `targets.yaml`
(id/path/config/canonical), runs each target
through the same `runWorkspaceAudit` the single-repo surfaces fold, and
aggregates a `FleetReport` whose entries preserve the full §6.4 report and
the §9 policy assessment — deep-equal to independent core audits. Drift
rides along per target as non-scoring evidence; it never enters the index
or the exit rollup (`assessFleet` fails on target errors and tripped
declarative policies only). Fleet runs are stateless by default;
`--history` records each run and surfaces index moves against stored
compatible baselines. `src/history/` renders the sloppiness dashboard —
latest-run snapshot with compatible index deltas plus per-repo
§3.5-compatible series (§10).)*

*(Per-target provider scope, trellis-f3e5 — plan `pl-43c5` step 20: optional
provider selection rides each fleet member's own configuration through the
same core service — the fleet layer holds no provider logic, planning or
policy of its own. Each member stages its own isolated source view under
trellis-owned scratch (a fresh temp directory per analysis, cleaned on every
exit path) and carries its own namespaced, unscored evidence on its own
report; a member without a selection stays byte-identical to a native-only
audit, and one member's provider failure, unavailability or cleanup problem
never touches another's report, score or the exit rollup. The fleet stays
sequential (no scheduling service), so members can never share or race on a
scratch path, and mixed situations — one member with complete evidence, one
unavailable, one unrequested — stay explicit per entry; the rendered views
project each member's carried analysis states per target, never summed or
averaged into anything score-like.)*

  [--baseline <report.json>]   # compare against a saved report (§9)
  [--config <trellis.yaml>]
  [--history]                  # opt-in persistence (§10)
trellis compare <a.json> <b.json>   # artifact comparison without an audit
trellis fleet                  # optional multi-repo run (§11)
trellis report                 # history views (only with --history data)

```

For `audit`, `--out <file>` sends the report to that file instead of stdout,
including when policy fails. `--json`/`--md` override the file extension's
format. The write confirmation and policy failure reasons go to stderr;
`--quiet` suppresses the confirmation.

The task-specific cleanup workflow is canonical in `src/guides/cleanup.ts`.
`getGuide` in `src/guides/index.ts`, the thin CLI `guide <name>`, and SDK
`guide(name)` share that content. Reading guidance needs no target and performs
no workspace I/O or command execution. Unknown names fail with supported names;
the CLI returns exit 1. Human/Markdown output is the guide text; JSON and the SDK
return `{ name, content }`. This is separate from general session orientation.
Plan `pl-d028` / `trellis-1e2d` updates this source as additional cleanup
capabilities land instead of maintaining another workflow copy.

- Terminal output shows headline index + completeness, raw metric summaries,
  score contributions, ranked hotspots, and safeguard evidence; JSON carries
  the full structured report; Markdown is a bounded summary. Every displayed
  score carries its direction and scoring version (§3.4).
  *(Landed, trellis-a059: `src/report/audit-{terminal,json,markdown}.ts`
  render the §6.4 report over the shared helpers in `audit-format.ts` — the
  index always shows `N/100 · lower is better · scoring <version>`, never a
  percentage; hotspot/finding lists are bounded with totals printed; the JSON
  renderer re-validates the contract at the boundary. `audit-fixtures.ts`
  audits the five render-fixture repositories — clean, sloppy,
  mixed-language, incomplete, function-free — through the real core.)*
- The SDK (`src/client/`) exposes the same audit/compare/fleet/report calls
  over the same core; deep-equal tests prove CLI and SDK are one code path.

*(CLI/SDK landed, trellis-9a88: `trellis audit` folds `runWorkspaceAudit`
(`src/audit/run.ts`) — configuration (`--config`, else the root's
`trellis.yaml`) → the deterministic core → baseline resolution
(`--baseline`, else the latest compatible stored run when `--history` is
on) → declarative policy assessment → opt-in persistence. The default run
is stateless: no database is opened and no report file is written unless
`--history`/`--out` ask. `trellis compare` folds `runComparison`
(`src/compare/run.ts`) — two artifacts, no audit — with terminal/Markdown
views in `src/report/compare-render.ts`; an incompatible pair fails closed
(exit 2, the comparison still emitted). The SDK's `audit`/`compare` are direct calls to the same
services; deep-equal parity tests cover measurement and policy.
`fleet`/`report` adapted with trellis-8366 (§11);
`drift`/`standards` remain separate canonical-config capabilities.)*

## 13. Tech stack & conventions

Unchanged from the warren/burrow stack:

- **Runtime:** Bun (runs TS directly, no build step for the CLI).
- **Language:** TypeScript strict (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, no `any`).
- **Parsing:** the pinned TypeScript compiler API and pinned in-process Lezer
  Python grammar — one shared parse per file reused by all **native** metrics
  within an audit. *(Optional providers,
  per the §16 contract, may run their own pinned engines behind the §16.4
  execution boundary, with their parser recorded in analysis identity
  — the shared-parse rule governs native measurement and is never weakened
  there.)*
- **Validation:** zod at every external boundary (contracts, configuration).
- **Lint/format:** Biome, `--error-on-warnings`.
- **Storage:** `bun:sqlite` (opt-in history only).
- **CLI:** commander; progress and handled errors write to stderr.
- **Conventions:** kebab-case filenames, tab indent / 100-col, `.ts` import
  extensions, tests as `<name>.test.ts` beside the unit, golden fixtures
  under `__golden__/`. trellis keeps the quality-gate ratchets and audits
  itself with the deterministic audit (dogfood, §14).

### 13.1 api>cli>sdk core discipline

All behavior lives in the surface-agnostic core modules under `src/`; the
CLI is a thin commander pass-through and the SDK a typed client whose types
mirror the core (`// Mirrors src/<x>`). There is exactly one implementation
of each operation, so surfaces cannot drift. There is **no HTTP server**; a
network API remains a deferred surface over the same core.

---

## 14. Validation and acceptance

Native measurement is tested against a fixed TypeScript corpus with recorded
revisions, analyzer versions, runtime and memory budgets. Paired refactors
exercise clone removal, branch growth and cycle introduction; score changes
require versioned calibration. Corpus preparation is separate from offline audits.

CLI, SDK and fleet parity tests exercise the same core, configuration, policy
and optional history. Package smoke tests verify the installed CLI and its assets.
See [release acceptance](docs/release-acceptance.md) and
[corpus validation](docs/corpus-validation.md) for evidence and limitations.

The separate [open-source benchmark acceptance](docs/open-source-benchmark-acceptance.md)
re-audits operator-prepared pinned TypeScript and Python repositories three
times in fresh processes. It fingerprints the measurement payload, records
runtime/RSS and source-located hotspots, and never changes default audit or CI
requirements. Incomplete full-repository graph coverage withholds the
headline; the benchmark does not treat popular projects as presumed low debt
or use safeguards/tests as score credit.

trellis audits itself offline. A regression in its own sloppiness index is a
real failure; safeguards and optional provider evidence never offset the score.

---

## 15. Deferred / open

- **Unused-code analysis** — dead exports, unreachable modules (deferred per
  §2 as a native capability; optional advisory reachability evidence is
  contracted in §16).
- **Broader architecture rules** — enforced layering/boundaries beyond cycle
  detection (optional advisory evidence for declared rules is contracted in
  §16; native enforcement stays deferred).
- **Project verification execution** — actually running checks; trellis stays
  an inspector, not a runner.
- **New language adapters** — Swift and others; the contracts keep
  `unsupported` coverage honest so this can land later without a schema
  break.
- **Web dashboard, hosted/scheduled service, auto-remediation fan-out,
  README badges** — adjacent surfaces over the same core, not now.

---

## 16. Optional quality-evidence providers (integration contract — plan `pl-43c5`)

> **Implementation status.** The report, comparison, policy, history and
> surface seams, jscpd, dependency-cruiser and Knip adapters, and explicit
> SonarJS deferral are delivered. Final integration acceptance is recorded
> under `trellis-639c`. See [`docs/quality-evidence.md`](docs/quality-evidence.md)
> for current usage and [`docs/provider-acceptance.md`](docs/provider-acceptance.md)
> for executed evidence and gaps. This contract builds on the completed
> foundation (§14); native measurement and scoring remain authoritative.

### 16.1 What a provider is — and is not

A **provider** is a pinned, deterministic local analysis tool that trellis
may run — **only when explicitly enabled by the operator** — to add
supplemental engineering-quality evidence to a report. Contracted
candidates: jscpd (duplication evidence), dependency-cruiser (declared
architecture-rule evidence), Knip (contextual reachability candidates);
SonarJS is gated (§16.7).

A provider is **not**: a model, agent, or network service (the §1 no-model
invariant covers providers without exception); a replacement for any
native analyzer; a scored signal; a runner of the target's scripts or
configuration; or any new default behavior. Optional providers are
supplemental in this delivery, and a provider's absence never marks code
clean or dirty.

This contract **explicitly revises two foundation restrictions** — the
restrictions, never the guarantees:

- **Shared-parser restriction (§13).** "One shared parse layer reused by
  all metrics" remains the rule for **native** metrics. An optional
  provider may run its own pinned engine (e.g. jscpd's Rust engine,
  Knip's parser) behind the §16.4 execution boundary, recording its
  parser/version in analysis identity (§16.2); trellis validates the
  provider's raw output before it becomes evidence.
- **Subprocess restriction (§8 "local parsing and arithmetic").** The
  native measurement pass is unchanged. An explicitly enabled provider
  may run as a **controlled local subprocess** over an isolated staged
  view — still offline, still never a target command, still no
  audit-time acquisition (§16.4).

The §5.3 jscpd decision is narrowed, not reversed (see the revision note
there): jscpd remains rejected as the native default engine and as a
scoring source; it is permitted as an optional, pinned, unscored
evidence provider.

**Unchanged guarantees:** no-model execution; no target commands and no
executable target configuration; no audit-time downloads (tool
acquisition is a separate operator preparation step — pinned and
discoverable per `trellis-ff52`); and the default audit stays offline and
zero-footprint (§8) — an unrequested provider runs nothing.

### 16.2 Identity, coverage, status, and states

Every provider analysis recorded in a report carries:

- **Provider identity** — a stable provider id, the pinned tool version,
  the trellis adapter version, and the exact mode/option set supplied.
- **Analysis identity** — what the analysis consumed: the input snapshot
  identity (selected source sets and files with content fingerprints),
  the provider's own parser/version where it differs from trellis's
  pinned TypeScript, and the trellis-owned declarative options in
  effect. Two analyses are identical only when all of these match.
- **Observed coverage** — what the analysis actually observed
  (files/lines, per source set), **asserted from the provider's own
  evidence, never inferred from exit status** (the spike recorded a
  successful empty graph from dependency-cruiser without its supported
  TypeScript parser, and filesystem-alias false positives from Knip).
  Coverage is evidence, not cleanliness: uncovered surface is reported,
  never scored as clean.
- **Status** — **required** or **advisory**, declared by the audit's
  declarative policy. Required evidence is demanded; advisory evidence is
  requested but optional. Unrequested or advisory absence never
  invalidates the native score (§16.5); a violated requirement trips
  policy (§16.3).

The allowed states for a provider analysis are exactly five:

| state | meaning |
|---|---|
| `complete` | ran over its full intended scope, with observed coverage asserted |
| `incomplete` | ran but did not cover the full intended scope — what and where is recorded |
| `unavailable` | enabled but could not run — missing or malformed pinned tool, exhausted execution limits; located, with reason |
| `unsupported` | enabled but the capability is not supported for this scope/platform/inputs — including a gated, explicitly deferred capability (§16.7); located, with reason |
| `unrequested` | not enabled for this run; no evidence exists |

Rules:

- **No invented metrics.** An absent execution is recorded as its state;
  it never materializes zero-valued metrics, "0 findings", or clean
  coverage. Absence is explicit.
- **No conflation with native states.** Provider states never roll into
  the native completeness rollup (§3.3): overall evidence completeness
  and score completeness are independent quantities. An optional
  provider's `unavailable` state never makes the native score partial
  and never blocks the headline index (the report-level split is
  designed in `trellis-a24d`).
- **Truthful success.** A successful run with empty or partial observed
  coverage is reported as exactly that — never as a silently clean
  result.

### 16.3 Failure semantics and exit codes

> **Delivered (trellis-68b9, plan `pl-43c5` step 7):** the declarative
> requirement surface is `policy.requireEvidence` in `trellis.yaml` (§6.5) —
> a list of supported analysis ids (§16.1), validated as pure data at
> config-load time (native `trellis.*` ids and `provider.*` evidence ids are
> rejected actionably; no command strings). `assessPolicy`
> (`src/compare/policy.ts` + `policy-evidence.ts`) fails the run closed on
> every unmet requirement — unrequested, unavailable, unsupported or
> incomplete — including a located `unsupported` citation for a deferred
> capability (§16.7), while budgets and `failOnNew` entries under the reserved
> `provider.` namespace evaluate over that analysis's carried evidence
> (step-6 compatibility rules apply) and never fabricate zero values.

- A **requested optional-provider failure is located unavailable/incomplete
  evidence**: the report carries the provider id, state, reason, and —
  where known — the location. It never becomes a clean result and never
  fabricates metrics.
- A **declarative requirement can trip policy**: when the audit's policy
  declares provider evidence required and that evidence is `unavailable`,
  `unsupported`, or `incomplete`, the run exits **`2`** — the report is
  still emitted to stdout, reasons go to stderr (§9). An advisory-only
  provider failure leaves the exit unchanged; the visible evidence in
  the report is the failure's surface.
- **Operational error `1` is preserved** for invalid configuration and
  inability to run the audit: a provider request that fails schema
  validation (unknown provider id, malformed options, contradictory
  requirements) fails fast with no report, and a failure that prevents
  the audit itself from running is operational. A *valid* request whose
  execution fails is evidence, not an abort — the native audit still
  runs and emits.
- Policy failure and operational failure remain always distinguishable
  (§9).

### 16.4 Execution, trust, and storage boundary

- **Default: no scratch.** A native audit (no provider enabled) creates
  no scratch files and writes nothing — §8 is unchanged.
- **Opt-in external execution may use isolated temporary storage owned by
  trellis** — a staged source view and working area — with trellis-owned
  cleanup when the run ends, and **never a write to the target
  workspace**. A cleanup failure is a visible, reported condition, never
  silently dropped.
- **Declarative requests only.** No executable target configuration and
  no arbitrary command strings are accepted. Provider requests are
  trellis-owned declarative data: a validated schema, pinned artifacts,
  trellis-supplied options. The target's own tool configuration (a
  discovered `.jscpd.json`, a `dep-cruiserrc.js`, …) is never executed
  or trusted — the spike showed jscpd auto-discovers ancestor configs;
  adapters must prevent that.
- **Trust boundary — supported installation.** The supported execution
  context is a local tool installation prepared by the operator (pinned,
  discoverable offline, `trellis-ff52`). trellis never installs, updates,
  or downloads tools at audit time. This boundary is a **controlled
  execution** statement, not a sandbox claim: it does not certify the
  execution environment as safe for arbitrary untrusted code. Resource
  limits, staged input snapshots, and raw-evidence validation (steps
  `trellis-eddc`, `trellis-2fe6`) are the compensating controls.
  > **Delivered (`trellis-ff52`, plan `pl-43c5` step 11):** the supported-
  > tool manifest/resolver (`src/providers/manifest.ts` +
  > `src/providers/resolve.ts`, see `docs/provider-tools.md`) pins jscpd
  > 5.2.1 as an isolated devDependency, resolves it only from the
  > operator-prepared local installation via trellis-owned `node_modules`
  > discovery (never PATH/`bunx`, never at audit time), and verifies the
  > resolved artifact against recorded digests before the process-runner
  > registry (`src/providers/process.ts`) may run it — with honest
  > per-platform execution records (`tested` / `research-tested` /
  > `declared-untested`) instead of universal platform claims.
  > **Delivered (`trellis-adbf`, plan `pl-43c5` step 22):** the manifest
  > also pins dependency-cruiser 18.3.1 — a pure-JavaScript distribution
  > whose launcher runs under trellis's own runtime through the controlled
  > process runner, with the tool's locally resolved TypeScript parser
  > version recorded in analysis identity before anything runs (a missing
  > parser produced a successful empty graph in the research record;
  > `src/providers/dependency-cruiser/` owns the adapter, its generated
  > tool config and its coverage-checked evidence).
- **Never**: target scripts, target verification, models, network
  fetches, opportunistic downloads, or credentials.

### 16.5 Scoring semantics

- **Provider observations are unscored under this plan.** The sloppiness
  index and its contributions are computed exclusively from native
  metrics under the calibrated formula (§7.1 constants, frozen after the
  `pl-b2ea` calibration). Provider data never enters the score in either
  direction.
- Provider findings live in their own **namespaced evidence area** of the
  report (§6.6) — located findings, never in the native metrics map and
  never under native finding kinds.
- **Absence never invalidates a native score.** An optional provider that
  is unrequested, unavailable, or incomplete does not make the native
  score partial and does not block the headline index (§16.2).
- **Backend promotion or extra weights require a separately versioned
  calibration** — an explicit scoring-version bump with its own corpus
  validation, outside this plan. A provider replacing a native analyzer
  as the default is likewise outside this plan.
- Summing provider counts into any composite quality number is rejected:
  one problem can trigger several providers, and provider absence can
  mean missing context rather than quality (spike record).

### 16.6 Compatibility and versioning rules

- **Comparisons evaluate per basis** (§9; designed in `trellis-bd0c`):
  - *Scored basis* — the native index compares under the existing
    analyzer/scoring/configuration compatibility rules. Provider
    presence, absence, or upgrade never changes the native index and
    never fragments score history; advisory-only provider changes
    cannot make two otherwise-compatible reports incompatible.
  - *Scored-measurement changes* — native analyzer/scoring changes keep
    the existing fail-closed behavior (§3.5, §9): incompatible pairs are
    reported explicitly, never silently trended.
  - *Evidence basis* — provider evidence compares only across identical
    provider identity (id + pinned tool version + adapter version +
    mode/options) and identical input/config identity; mismatches are
    reported explicitly (incompatible or caveated), never silently
    trended.
- **Input/config identity**: a provider observation's identity is its
  provider identity plus its analysis identity (§16.2). A changed option
  set or a changed source scope is a different analysis — never
  presented as the same evidence continuing a trend.
- **Older artifacts remain valid**: reports produced without providers
  (or with fewer) load and compare. Missing provider evidence in an
  older artifact reads as `unrequested`, never as a regression or an
  `unavailable` failure. Provider availability added later never
  rewrites stored history (§10).
- **Schema evolution**: provider evidence is an additive, versioned
  report change (§6.6; steps `trellis-a24d`, `trellis-bba6`); older
  schemas stay loadable per §9.

### 16.7 Sonar decision gate

SonarJS evidence is **contingent on an affirmative, documented
distribution and metric-interface decision** (`trellis-db3e`). The spike
recorded conflicting license evidence (package metadata reads
`LGPL-3.0-only` while the shipped header identifies the Sonar
Source-Available License v1.0) and that the research metric adapter parses
threshold-zero diagnostics through a pinned research adapter — not a
stable public metric API. Distribution cannot be inferred from metadata.

Until the decision clears a route, Sonar evidence is **explicitly
deferred**: the provider id is known, so a request for it is valid
configuration, but it resolves to `unsupported` with the deferral reason
recorded. The deferral is visible and policy-testable — a declarative
requirement on it fails closed (§16.3) — and no nonexistent analysis is
ever reported as `complete`. A deferred outcome is a documented capability
state (`trellis-7b99` owns the follow-through), not a claim of
implementation.

> **Decision recorded (`trellis-db3e`, plan `pl-43c5` step 25): DEFERRED.**
> The bounded decision record is
> [`docs/sonarjs-decision.md`](docs/sonarjs-decision.md): the pinned
> `eslint-plugin-sonarjs` 3.0.5 distribution's `LGPL-3.0-only` package
> metadata conflicts with its shipped SONAR Source-Available License v1.0
> text, so no permitted distribution route is established and the research
> diagnostic adapter is not adopted as a metric API. The typed capability
> carrier is `src/providers/capabilities.ts` (a `sonarjs` request is known
> configuration resolving to `unsupported` with the recorded reason); the
> clearance prerequisite is tracked separately as `trellis-7f5d`.

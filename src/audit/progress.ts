/**
 * Deterministic-audit progress events (SPEC §4, trellis-ef85) — the
 * structured, **bounded** signal the audit core emits while it walks the
 * one-directional pipeline:
 *
 *   configure → discover → parse → measure → safeguards → score → assemble
 *
 * "Bounded" is the contract: the number of events is a function of the
 * pipeline shape (7 phases, the selected measured analyzers), never of
 * repository size — a 10-file repo and a 10,000-file repo emit the same
 * number of events, so renderers can never be flooded by a large workspace.
 *
 * Since the registry routing (trellis-1e66), the `measure` phase executes
 * the native capability registry's measured selection (`src/analysis/`),
 * so analyzer events derive from that selected execution list: one event
 * per selected analyzer, in execution order, with `index`/`total` from the
 * list itself. `ANALYZER_IDS` below is the explicit progress-id mirror of
 * that selection, and {@link analyzerProgressId} maps registry ids onto it
 * — the orchestration tests pin the mirror against the registry so the two
 * can never drift apart.
 *
 * Events never alter control flow or the resulting report — a run with no
 * sink wired produces a byte-identical measurement payload (SPEC §3.5).

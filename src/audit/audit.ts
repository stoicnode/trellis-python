/**
 * The deterministic audit core (SPEC §4, trellis-ef85) — one core call that
 * audits a TS/TSX workspace end to end and assembles the §6.4 report:
 *
 *   configure → discover → parse (one shared inventory) → measure (the
 *   native capability registry's measured selection) → safeguards → score
 *   (pure, provisional formula) → assemble report
 *
 * Since trellis-1e66 the measure phase consumes the registered native
 * analyzers (`src/analysis/`, trellis-cb51) instead of calling the four
 * analyzers inline: the registry owns selection and execution order,
 * {@link measureAnalyses} runs each selected analyzer through its registered
 * wrapper over the one shared parse, and assembly folds whatever the selected
 * execution list produced — no analyzer is hardcoded into the pipeline.
 * Native behavior is unchanged: the wrapped products are the existing
 * analyzers' outputs, so metrics, findings, ordering, score, safeguards and
 * the report bytes are identical to the pre-refactor baseline (proven by the
 * orchestration payload-equality tests), and no external provider is
 * selected or started — the registry holds native analyzers only at this
 * stage. Since trellis-a24d the assembled report carries the per-analysis
 * evidence area (§6.6): provenance, status, observed coverage and the
 * declared scoring role per measured analysis, with overall evidence
 * completeness independent from score completeness (§16.2).
 *
 * Invariants (SPEC §8):
 *
 * - **No model, no network, no credentials** — local parsing and arithmetic
 *   only; there is nothing to connect. An explicitly requested optional
 *   provider (§16, plan `pl-43c5` step 15) may run as a controlled local
 *   subprocess over an isolated staged view — still offline, still never a
 *   target command; the default audit (no provider requested) stages
 *   nothing, launches nothing, writes nothing.
 * - **No project commands** — the target's scripts are never executed and
 *   its executable configuration is never imported.
 * - **No database, zero footprint** — the run writes nothing; persistence
 *   (trellis-424d) and policy evaluation (trellis-942c) live outside the
 *   measurement pass and consume the returned report. The only scratch a
 *   run may create is trellis-owned temporary storage for an explicitly
 *   requested provider, cleaned on every exit path (§16.4).
 * - **No Git required** — dirty worktrees and non-Git directories are
 *   analyzed exactly as they exist on disk.
 *
 * Determinism (SPEC §3.5): same files + same configuration + same
 * analyzer/scoring versions ⇒ equal measurement payload
 * ({@link import("../contract/index.ts").measurementPayload}). The only
 * nondeterministic fields are run metadata (`run.auditedAt`,
 * `run.durationMs`), which are excluded from the payload; `now` exists so
 * callers can pin the timestamp.
 *
 * Partial analysis is honest (SPEC §3.3): parse failures, unresolved
 * imports, and resource-budget exhaustion degrade the affected metrics to
 * `incomplete` with reasons — the report's completeness rollup and the
 * `partial` headline flag follow mechanically, and every other analyzer's
 * findings remain fully usable.

/**
 * Declarative provider selection → the audit's execution plan and evidence
 * (SPEC §16.3–16.5, plan `pl-43c5` step 15 — trellis-15e3).
 *
 * The `providers` block of the audit configuration (§6.5,
 * `src/contract/config.ts`) is pure data: {@link providerExecutionPlan}
 * translates it into a **deterministic execution plan** — one entry per
 * explicitly requested provider, sorted by provider id — and
 * {@link runProviderAnalyses} executes that plan into the contract's
 * analysis results, which assembly folds into the report's additive
 * evidence area (§6.6) as **advisory, namespaced, unscored** evidence.
 *
 * Invariants (§16.4, §16.5):
 *
 * - **Default selects nothing.** An absent `providers` block (or an empty
 *   one) yields an empty plan: no source is staged, no process is launched,
 *   no scratch is created, and the report is byte-identical to the
 *   native-only pipeline. Only an explicitly requested provider stages a
 *   view or runs anything.
 * - **Delivered providers run per request.** jscpd (the delivered adapter,
 *   `src/providers/jscpd/`), dependency-cruiser (the delivered adapter,
 *   `src/providers/dependency-cruiser/`, evaluating the declarative
 *   architecture-policy subset over the same measured selection) and knip
 *   (the delivered adapter, `src/providers/knip/`, evaluating the prepared
 *   declarative reachability context over the same measured selection)
 *   stage the audit's measured production/test selection through the
 *   owned-scratch lifecycle and resolve per run.
 * - **Undelivered or gated providers resolve to located `unsupported`
 *   evidence** with the capability table's recorded reason
 *   (`src/providers/capabilities.ts` — including the deferred SonarJS
 *   decision, §16.7): a request is valid configuration even when the
 *   capability cannot execute, and the recorded reason — never a fabricated
 *   clean result — is the surface (§16.2).
 * - **Provider evidence never scores and never displaces native results**
 *   (§16.5): every result here is `kind: "external"` with namespaced ids;
 *   assembly keeps it out of the report's metrics map and findings list.
 * - **Cancellation and cleanup propagate** (§16.4): the audit's cancellation
 *   handle flows to staging, the adapter and every provider process, and
 *   owned scratch is cleaned on every exit path; a cancelled or failed
 *   provider is located evidence, never an abort of the native audit.

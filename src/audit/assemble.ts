/**
 * Report assembly (SPEC §6.4, §6.6, trellis-ef85) — the pure fold from analysis
 * results to the versioned {@link AuditReport}.
 *
 * {@link assembleReport} takes the discovery/syntax inventories, the measured
 * analyzers' results (the selected execution list — see
 * `measureAnalyses` in `audit.ts`), the safeguard inspection, and the
 * provisional sloppiness score, and produces the §6.4 report:
 *
 * - every analyzer metric is emitted exactly once (a duplicate id is a core
 *   bug and throws — the deterministic pipeline never papers it over);
 * - findings are deterministically ordered: kinds grouped lexicographically
 *   with each analyzer's internal (already deterministic) order preserved,
 *   so hotspots keep their mass rank within their kind (SPEC §3.2);
 * - source coverage pairs discovery's per-scope file counts with the
 *   measured code-line counts from the one shared parse (§3.1);
 * - `repo.identity` is the root manifest's `name` when one exists — metadata
 *   only (§8); history (trellis-424d) owns collision-resistant identity;
 * - the report carries the per-analysis evidence area (§6.6,
 *   trellis-a24d): one entry per measured analysis with its provenance,
 *   status and observed coverage, its declared scoring role, and the metric
 *   ids it owns — native measured output (values, findings) stays in the
 *   report's own areas and is never duplicated per entry. The area's
 *   completeness is the independent overall-evidence rollup; score
 *   completeness comes from the scoring input alone, so the two can never
 *   paper over each other (§16.2);
 * - the assembled report is validated against the versioned report schema
 *   before it leaves the core, so the §6.4 cross-field honesty invariants
 *   (completeness rollup, `partial` flag, traceable contributions, metric
 *   ownership, evidence status) can never be violated by a published
 *   report.
 *
 * The fold is generic over the measured results ({@link MeasuredAnalysis} —
 * the structural minimum every measured analyzer's product satisfies): since
 * the registry routing (trellis-1e66) assembly consumes whatever the selected
 * execution list produced rather than a hardcoded four-analyzer set, the
 * wrapped native runs carry the same metrics and findings the inline
 * analyzers did.
 *
 * This module does no I/O, reads no clock, and never scores: same analysis
 * results in ⇒ byte-equal report out (SPEC §3.5). Run metadata
 * (`auditedAt`, `durationMs`) is attached by the caller and is excluded
 * from the deterministic measurement payload (§6.4).

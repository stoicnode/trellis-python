/**
 * The staged-view lifecycle wrapper (SPEC §16.4, plan `pl-43c5` —
 * trellis-2fe6): run one provider adapter callback against a staged
 * workspace view with guaranteed trellis-owned scratch cleanup.
 *
 * `withStagedWorkspaceView` composes {@link stageWorkspaceView} with the
 * adapter callback and cleans the owned scratch directory on **every** exit
 * path: adapter success, adapter failure, wall-time timeout, and caller
 * cancellation (an already-aborted signal stages nothing at all). Outcomes
 * are structured — an adapter failure is carried, not rethrown, so callers
 * translate it into located provider evidence states (§16.3) — and a cleanup
 * failure is reported in the outcome without ever masking the original
 * result: the adapter's value or error always wins its outcome kind.
 *
 * The wall-time limit bounds **waiting** for the adapter, and stopping the
 * wait stops the work: the lifecycle owns an internal abort handle it
 * hands to the adapter callback, and a wall-time limit or caller
 * cancellation aborts it — adapters drive `runControlledProcess` (process.ts)
 * with that signal, which terminates the provider's process group, so a
 * limit actually stops the work. After a timeout or cancellation the
 * wrapper stops waiting and cleans immediately; a callback that ignores
 * the handed-off signal keeps running detached over its already-removed
 * scratch and its late result is discarded. No execution metadata
 * (timestamps, pids, durations) is recorded, preserving determinism of
 * downstream evidence.

/**
 * One dependency-cruiser provider analysis over a workspace selection (SPEC
 * §16.2–16.5, plan `pl-43c5` step 22 — trellis-adbf; the audit-side wiring
 * lives in `src/audit/providers.ts`).
 *
 * {@link runDependencyCruiserAnalysis} composes the delivered boundaries
 * unchanged into the contract's {@link AnalysisResult}: it stages an
 * isolated source view of the selection (`../workspace.ts` through the
 * `../staged-run.ts` lifecycle with guaranteed owned-scratch cleanup), runs
 * the pinned adapter (`./adapter.ts` — resolver, controlled process runner,
 * generated tool config, raw validation), normalizes the one cruise's
 * report over the staged snapshot (`./normalize.ts`), and folds the
 * outcome to typed evidence.
 *
 * Honesty rules the fold enforces (mirroring the jscpd fold,
 * `../jscpd/analysis.ts`):
 *
 * - **Per-run states.** The cruise outcome's state is carried as-is; no
 *   invented metrics — a never-ran analysis carries only its located
 *   reason. A zero-rule request is valid and runs: an absent rule set is
 *   recorded identity (rule count `0`), never a coherence claim.
 * - **Normalized evidence attaches only from the staged snapshot.** The
 *   accounted files are the staged copies (exactly the bytes the pinned
 *   tool consumed). Normalization failure degrades to `incomplete` with
 *   the located reason — provider evidence never aborts the audit.
 * - **Coverage honesty is the point.** An empty or partial graph is
 *   `incomplete` with its located reason and its observed coverage — never
 *   a clean pass with zero violations; builtins, externals and
 *   unresolved-local stubs stay separate evidence.
 * - **Cleanup is visible (§16.4).** A failed owned-scratch cleanup is never
 *   silently dropped: a `complete` result degrades to `incomplete` with the
 *   cleanup failure as its located reason, and any other state appends it.
 * - **Never a native result.** The result is always the external
 *   `dependency-cruiser` identity with namespaced, unscored evidence
 *   (§16.5); every failure keeps the native audit untouched.

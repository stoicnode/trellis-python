/**
 * One knip provider analysis over a workspace selection (SPEC §16.2–16.5,
 * plan `pl-43c5` step 24 — trellis-8ebc; the audit-side wiring lives in
 * `src/audit/providers.ts`).
 *
 * {@link runKnipAnalysis} composes the delivered boundaries unchanged into
 * the contract's {@link AnalysisResult}: it compiles the declarative
 * request (step 23's `./policy.ts`) and prepares the reachability context
 * over the **audit's measured selection** — before any staging, so the
 * recorded roots and contextual assumptions describe the audited selection,
 * never a staged subset — then stages an isolated source-only view of
 * exactly the context's scope (the roots plus the production project files;
 * non-participating test files are outside the analysis: they supply no
 * evidence and never dilute production denominators, AC2), runs the pinned
 * adapter (`./adapter.ts` — resolver, controlled process runner, generated
 * configuration, raw validation), normalizes the one pass's report over the
 * staged snapshot (`./normalize.ts`), and folds the outcome to typed
 * evidence.
 *
 * Honesty rules the fold enforces (mirroring the jscpd/dependency-cruiser
 * folds):
 *
 * - **Per-run states.** The pass outcome's state is carried as-is; no
 *   invented metrics — a never-ran analysis carries only its located
 *   reason.
 * - **Normalized evidence attaches only from the staged snapshot.** The
 *   accounted files are the staged copies (exactly the bytes the pinned
 *   tool consumed). Normalization failure degrades to `incomplete` with
 *   the located reason — provider evidence never aborts the audit.
 * - **Coverage honesty is the point.** An empty or partial pass
 *   (`incomplete`) carries its located reason and the observed scope; only
 *   a validated report over a fully staged, pattern-coherent scope is
 *   `complete`. A zero-candidate report over a coherent scope is a clean
 *   zero — and zero findings never proves overall quality.
 * - **Cleanup is visible (§16.4).** A failed owned-scratch cleanup degrades
 *   a `complete` result to `incomplete` with the failure as its located
 *   reason, and appends to any other state.
 * - **Never a native result.** The result is always the external `knip`
 *   identity with namespaced, unscored evidence (§16.5); every failure
 *   keeps the native audit untouched.

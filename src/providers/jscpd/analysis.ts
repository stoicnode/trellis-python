/**
 * One jscpd provider analysis over a workspace selection (SPEC §16.2–16.5,
 * plan `pl-43c5` step 15 — trellis-15e3; the audit-side wiring lives in
 * `src/audit/providers.ts`).
 *
 * {@link runJscpdAnalysis} composes the delivered boundaries unchanged into
 * the contract's {@link AnalysisResult}: it stages an isolated source view of
 * the selection (`../workspace.ts` through the `../staged-run.ts` lifecycle
 * with guaranteed owned-scratch cleanup), runs the pinned adapter
 * (`./adapter.ts` — resolver, controlled process runner, fixed argv, raw
 * validation), normalizes the one requested mode's report over the staged
 * snapshot (`./normalize.ts`), and folds the outcome to typed evidence.
 *
 * Honesty rules the fold enforces:
 *
 * - **Per-run states.** The mode outcome's state is carried as-is
 *   (`complete`/`incomplete`/`unavailable`/`unsupported`); no invented
 *   metrics — a never-ran analysis carries only its located reason.
 * - **Normalized evidence attaches only from the staged snapshot.** The
 *   accounted files are the staged copies (exactly the bytes the pinned tool
 *   consumed), so line accounting can never describe content the tool did
 *   not analyze. Normalization failure degrades to `incomplete` with the
 *   reason — provider evidence never aborts the audit.
 * - **Cleanup is visible (§16.4).** A failed owned-scratch cleanup is never
 *   silently dropped: a `complete` result degrades to `incomplete` with the
 *   cleanup failure as its located reason (a cleanup failure is never a
 *   clean result), and any other state appends it to its reason.
 * - **Never a native result.** The result is always the external `jscpd`
 *   identity with namespaced, unscored evidence (§16.5); every failure keeps
 *   the native audit untouched.

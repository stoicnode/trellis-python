/**
 * Duplication detection (SPEC §5.3, trellis-6e4c) — trellis's own
 * normalized-token clone detector over the shared syntax inventory. No
 * runtime dependency: the pinned compiler's AST walk yields the token
 * stream, and detection uses bounded induced suffix sorting and LCP intervals over it.
 *
 * This module holds the detection **contract** (types, budgets, minimums)
 * and the token-stream collector; the matching engine lives in
 * `duplication-candidate.ts`, with the stable entry point in `duplication-detect.ts`
 * and bounded group finalization in `duplication-finalize.ts`.
 *
 * Documented semantics (fixed by the trellis-5a91 decision, SPEC §5.3):
 *
 * - **Token stream**: the leaf tokens of the shared `ts.SourceFile` in
 *   document order (comments and trivia never appear; the end-of-file
 *   token is dropped). A raw scanner loop is deliberately not used — it
 *   mis-tokenizes template literals without manual re-scan state.
 * - **Normalization**: every identifier maps to one placeholder, every
 *   literal (string, numeric, bigint, regex, template part) maps to one
 *   placeholder; all other tokens keep their `SyntaxKind`. This detects
 *   exact (type-1) and identifier/literal-renamed (type-2) clones. Near
 *   clones (type-3) are out of scope: a divergence splits a match into
 *   maximal exact-normalized runs, each reported independently.
 * - **Minimum clone size** (calibrated by trellis-e924 against the fixed
 *   corpus in `corpus/`; see `docs/corpus-validation.md`):
 *   {@link DUPLICATION_MIN_TOKENS} normalized tokens **and**
 *   {@link DUPLICATION_MIN_LINES} lines, both required, per member.
 * - **Grouping**: a clone group is the set of ranges sharing one identical
 *   normalized token sequence (content identity), with at least two
 *   members after dropping same-file token-contained members; there is no
 *   transitive pairwise merging. A group whose every member is
 *   token-contained in members of other groups is subsumed and dropped
 *   (the shared region of two overlapping clones is not a third clone).
 *   Within-file repeats count as clones.
 * - **Ranges** are token-exact maximal runs; a reported line range may
 *   overhang a partial boundary line (accepted semantics, matching both
 *   jscpd engines).
 * - **Bounded feasibility**: {@link DuplicationBudget} declares a token
 *   count and a match-work budget; exhaustion trips `incomplete` with the
 *   reason — never a silent clean result.
 *
 * Detection runs **per source set** (the caller passes one set's streams);
 * token streams are never matched across sets. Ordering is deterministic:
 * groups and members are sorted by location, never by filesystem
 * enumeration or hash-map order.

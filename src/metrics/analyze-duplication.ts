/**
 * Duplication analysis over the shared syntax inventory (SPEC §5.3,
 * trellis-6e4c).
 *
 * {@link analyzeDuplication} consumes the one shared parse
 * ({@link SyntaxInventory}) and runs the normalized-token clone detector
 * (`duplication.ts`) **per source set** — `production` and `test` are always
 * measured separately, and token streams are never matched across sets.
 * `generated`, `vendored`, `declaration-only`, and excluded files are never
 * tokenized, so no clone can cross those scopes.
 *
 * Outputs per scope:
 *
 * - stable clone groups (`clone-group-<n>` ids assigned after deterministic
 *   sorting) with member line ranges and copy counts;
 * - the **unique duplicated lines** numerator: the union of code-classified
 *   lines (the syntax layer's §5.1 line rules) covered by any member range,
 *   counted once per file — overlapping or nested groups never
 *   double-count;
 * - the **density** over the documented compatible denominator: the scope's
 *   total code-classified lines (a ratio of compatible quantities);
 * - contract `MetricValue`s (`duplication.groups.<set>`,
 *   `duplication.duplicated-lines.<set>`, `duplication.density.<set>`) and
 *   one `duplication.clone-group` finding per group.
 *
 * State rules (SPEC §3.3):
 *
 * - Any resource exhaustion discards uncommitted groups/totals: every scope
 *   metric is `incomplete` with the located reason and no value. A stopped
 *   traversal is never published as complete or as measured zero debt.
 * - A scope containing files with parse diagnostics is `incomplete` with
 *   partial values (same rule as complexity, SPEC §5.1).
 * - A scope with zero code-classified lines has a `not-applicable` density
 *   (a 0/0 ratio is meaningless); counts stay finite (`0`) and `complete`.

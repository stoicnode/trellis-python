/**
 * Dependency-graph analysis over the shared syntax inventory (SPEC §5.4,
 * trellis-d214).
 *
 * {@link analyzeDependencyGraph} resolves every import site of every
 * classified file ({@link collectImportSites} over the one shared parse;
 * {@link createGraphResolver} over local files/configuration only) into the
 * typed, versioned {@link DependencyGraph} — the graph foundation cycle
 * measurement (trellis-cbde) consumes.
 *
 * Contract outputs:
 *
 * - `graph.files` — node count (every classified file), always `complete`.
 * - `graph.edges.local` — resolved intra-workspace edges; `detail` splits
 *   them by kind and `typeOnly` and counts `out-of-scope` edges (resolved to
 *   real files outside the classified scope).
 * - `graph.edges.external` — external-package edges; `detail` counts the
 *   distinct packages. Externals are recorded, never resolved into
 *   (versioned policy `externalPackages: "recorded-never-resolved"`).
 * - `graph.edges.unresolved` — local-intent edges that failed to resolve;
 *   count and located findings are always retained. The metric is
 *   `incomplete` only when an unknown edge could join two scored nodes;
 *   Python runtime-selected and absent targets are observed-only evidence.
 *
 * State rules (SPEC §3.3 — the existing analyzer pattern): files with parse
 * diagnostics may hide import sites, so their presence makes every edge
 * metric `incomplete` with partial values and a reason naming the affected
 * file count; `graph.files` stays `complete` (the nodes are known).
 *
 * One `graph.unresolved-import` finding per unresolved edge carries the exact
 * location, specifier, kind, and machine-checkable reason. Determinism:
 * nodes follow the (sorted) inventory, edges follow source order within each
 * file, and every aggregate is sorted — same tree in ⇒ byte-equal graph out
 * (SPEC §3.5).

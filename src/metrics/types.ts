/**
 * Complexity & erosion measurement types (SPEC §5.1–5.2, trellis-fbc5).
 *
 * This module family measures raw structural facts over the shared syntax
 * inventory (trellis-d81d): per-function cyclomatic complexity, maximum
 * nesting depth, and source size, plus structural erosion (complexity
 * weighted by size). It emits contract `MetricValue`s and `Finding`s
 * (trellis-58a6) — **no scoring**: size and nesting are explanatory signals
 * unless the scoring formula (trellis-00d5) explicitly includes them.
 *
 * Scope rules (binding, SPEC §3.1/§5.2):
 *
 * - Only `production` and `test` source sets are measured, and always
 *   **separately** — every metric id ends in the source set, and no number
 *   ever mixes the two.
 * - Aggregation functions → packages → repo scope uses **summed masses**,
 *   never averages of package percentages: a scope's eroded-mass share is
 *   `Σ eroded mass / Σ mass` over its functions, so a big package's erosion
 *   is never diluted by averaging it against tiny packages.
 * - Empty or function-free scopes produce documented finite values
 *   (counts, total mass: `0`) or `not-applicable` states (distributions,
 *   the eroded-mass share — a 0/0 ratio is meaningless), never crashes or
 *   silent zeros. A scope with parse diagnostics is `incomplete` with
 *   partial values instead — `not-applicable` never hides an analysis
 *   failure (SPEC §3.3).

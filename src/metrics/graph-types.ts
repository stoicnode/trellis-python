/**
 * Dependency-graph contract and the **versioned graph policy** (SPEC §5.4,
 * trellis-d214).
 *
 * The dependency graph is the resolved, typed import structure of the audited
 * workspace: every classified TS/TSX file is a {@link GraphNode}; every import
 * site discovered in the shared parse is a {@link GraphEdge} whose
 * {@link EdgeResolution} records exactly what the specifier resolved to — a
 * local file, an out-of-scope file, an external package, or a documented
 * unresolved outcome. Cycle measurement (trellis-cbde) and scoring
 * (trellis-00d5) consume this graph; construction itself never scores.
 *
 * Documented rules (binding on all consumers):
 *
 * - **Edges are typed.** `import type` / `export type … from` / type-position
 *   `import("…")` produce `typeOnly: true` edges that keep their identity and
 *   are never merged with runtime edges. Whether they are *scored* separately
 *   is fixed by {@link GRAPH_POLICY} (`typeOnlyEdges: "retained-distinct"`) —
 *   the graph always carries the distinction.
 * - **Edge kinds.** `import` (static imports, TS import-equals, and
 *   type-position import types), `re-export` (`export … from`, `export *`),
 *   and `dynamic` (value-position `import("…")` call expressions) are
 *   distinct kinds. CommonJS `require(…)` calls are **not** recorded (the
 *   audit scope is TS/ESM source; a require-only dependency surface is
 *   visible as the absence of edges, never forged).
 * - **Self-edges are retained.** A file importing itself records a `local`
 *   edge whose `target` equals `from`; cycle policy downstream
 *   (trellis-cbde) decides what a self-edge means.
 * - **Externals are never resolved into.** Bare specifiers that are neither
 *   tsconfig aliases nor local workspace packages are `external` edges
 *   recorded by package name. Resolution uses local files and configuration
 *   only — `node_modules` is never consulted, so absent dependencies change
 *   nothing (SPEC §8: no fetch, no probe, no install-state dependence).
 * - **Unresolved local intent is surfaced.** A relative specifier, a matched
 *   tsconfig path mapping, or a workspace-package specifier that fails to
 *   resolve is an `unresolved` edge with a machine-checkable
 *   {@link UnresolvedReason} — distinguishable from externals, and rolled up
 *   as `incomplete` coverage (SPEC §3.3).

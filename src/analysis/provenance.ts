/**
 * Provenance assembly for native analyzer runs (SPEC §16.2, trellis-cb51).
 *
 * The wrappers in `native.ts` use these helpers to wrap trellis's existing
 * analyzers in the step-2 typed interfaces: the **analysis identity** (what
 * the analysis consumed — the measured source selection with content
 * fingerprints, the pinned shared parser, the trellis-owned options) and the
 * **observed coverage** (what it actually analyzed — asserted from its own
 * evidence, never inferred).
 *
 * Documented state mapping (the §16.2 provider states, kept strictly
 * separate from the native §3.3 metric states): a native analyzer is a pure
 * pass over the one shared syntax inventory, so it always processes exactly
 * its selection — `complete`, with observed coverage asserting that
 * selection. When any selected file produced parse diagnostics, the run is
 * `incomplete` with those diagnostics recorded as its coverage gap; every
 * other native degradation (unresolved imports, duplication budget
 * exhaustion) stays where the native contract already carries it — the
 * metric states inside the same result, which the wrapper never alters.
 *
 * Fingerprints are computed from the shared parse's own text — no re-read,
 * no extra parse (§13 one shared parse). ASTs and internal caches never
 * enter the identity, coverage, or evidence (AC2).

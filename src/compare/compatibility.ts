/**
 * Scored-basis compatibility (SPEC §3.5, §9, §16.6 — plan `pl-43c5` step 6,
 * trellis-bd0c).
 *
 * The **scored basis** is what the native sloppiness index and its raw
 * metrics/findings are computed from, and it is evaluated separately from
 * the advisory evidence basis (`evidence.ts`): advisory-only changes —
 * adding, removing, or upgrading an optional provider — can never make
 * two otherwise-compatible reports incompatible here (§16.6).
 *
 * Hard incompatibilities (fail closed, §9 — no score/metric/finding deltas
 * are ever silently computed):
 *
 * - `schema-version` — a side's version is not one this trellis reads
 *   (artifact loading rejects these earlier; kept as a defensive refusal),
 *   or an identity-bearing 1.2.0 report is paired with a historical schema;
 * - `analyzer-version` — the trellis releases differ;
 * - `scoring-version` — the formula versions differ, so the indices are
 *   not on one scale;
 * - `metric-set` — the **scored** metric catalogs differ. Pre-provider
 *   (1.0.0) reports read under their original interpretation (every metric
 *   is a score input); on evidence-carrying reports the catalog is
 *   the metrics owned by the declared **scored** analyses, so adding or
 *   removing an *advisory* analysis never trips this (§16.6);
 * - `configuration` — both source configurations were supplied and their
 *   `exclude`/`classify` semantics differ;
 * - `scored-measurement` — a scored analysis's **recorded** producer
 *   semantics differ (pinned tool/adapter version, mode, provider options,
 *   parser, normalized options) even when the version triple matches: the
 *   core version alone never establishes comparable measurements;
 * - `scoring-basis` — on an evidence-carrying pair the declared scored analysis sets
 *   differ, so the score's inputs are not the same set.
 *
 * Caveats (the comparison proceeds, explicitly):
 *
 * - `schema-span` — a 1.0.0 ↔ 1.1.0 pair: the pre-provider side predates
 *   the evidence area, so provider evidence is not compared on that side
 *   (it reads as unrequested), while the scored measurement body is
 *   unchanged between these additive versions and still compares;
 * - `configuration-unverifiable` — configurations were not supplied;
 * - `source-scope-changed` — the covered populations differ (normal code
 *   growth, or exclusion drift); a changed source revision is the expected
 *   input of a comparison, never a refusal.

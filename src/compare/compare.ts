/**
 * Baseline comparison of two §6.4 report artifacts (SPEC §9, trellis-942c;
 * per-basis compatibility — plan `pl-43c5` step 6, trellis-bd0c).
 *
 * {@link compareReports} is a pure function over two already-validated
 * {@link AuditReport}s — no Git, no SQLite, no filesystem. Loading the
 * artifacts lives in `load.ts`; policy evaluation lives in `policy.ts`.
 * Compatibility is evaluated **per basis** (§16.6), never per whole report:
 *
 * - the **scored basis** (`compatibility`, from `compatibility.ts`) gates
 *   the native index, raw-metric and finding deltas: analyzer/scoring
 *   versions, scored metric catalogs, supplied configurations, and the
 *   scored analyses' recorded measurement semantics. Incompatible pairs
 *   fail closed — `comparable: false`, no deltas computed, never silently
 *   compared. Advisory-only provider changes never enter this basis.
 * - the **evidence basis** (`evidence`, from `evidence.ts`) is assessed
 *   independently per carried provider: identical producer/scope semantics
 *   compare (a changed source revision is the expected input, caveated),
 *   and a changed provider/parser/options/selection basis is an explicit
 *   noncomparable dimension — never fictitious deltas or finding churn.
 *
 * The two bases are independent in both directions: an incompatible scored
 * pair still carries its per-provider evidence verdicts, and a
 * noncomparable provider dimension never fragments the native score
 * comparison. Pre-provider (schema 1.0.0) artifacts compare with each other
 * under their original interpretation, and a 1.0.0 ↔ 1.1.0 pair compares
 * the scored basis explicitly (`schema-span` caveat) while the pre-provider
 * side's provider evidence reads as unrequested — never a regression.

/**
 * The report's evidence area (SPEC §6.6, §16.2 — plan `pl-43c5` step 5,
 * trellis-a24d).
 *
 * The §6.4 report gains an **additive per-analysis evidence area**: one entry
 * per carried analysis, native or external, each carrying the step-2 analysis
 * result — provider identity, one of the five §16.2 states, analysis
 * identity, observed coverage — plus the two report-level declarations that
 * make completeness honest:
 *
 * - `scoring` — the analysis's role in the report's score (§16.5): **scored**
 *   analyses feed the index; **advisory** analyses never do. Score
 *   completeness is computed only from the declared scored inputs, so an
 *   absent, unavailable or incomplete advisory analysis can never flip a
 *   complete native score to partial — and a scored prerequisite's failure
 *   still does.
 * - `metricIds` — the native metric ids the analysis owns. Native evidence
 *   (values, findings) lives in the report's own areas and is never
 *   duplicated per entry; external evidence is namespaced inside its entry
 *   and never owns native metrics (§16.5).
 *
 * The area also carries the **overall evidence completeness** — rolled up
 * from every carried analysis state plus the native metric states — which is
 * an independent quantity from score completeness (§16.2): neither implies
 * the other.

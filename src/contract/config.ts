/**
 * Audit configuration contract (SPEC §6.5, §16.3 — plan `pl-43c5` step 15,
 * trellis-15e3) — declarative data, never code.
 *
 * Per-repo configuration (`trellis.yaml`, optional; sensible defaults without
 * it) describes source exclusions/classification, optional provider
 * selection, and the failure policy. It contains **no executable hooks**: the
 * schema is pure data (strings, numbers, lists, maps), and strict objects
 * reject any unknown key — including any attempt to smuggle in hook commands
 * or to override scoring weights. Policy budgets gate the run (§9); they
 * never mutate how the index is computed (§7).
 *
 * **Provider selection (§16.4)** is the `providers` block: a strict map of
 * known optional-provider ids to per-provider request data. Selection is
 * *additive evidence only* — a requested provider never changes the native
 * measurement or the score (§16.5), and an absent block (the default)
 * requests nothing, so the default audit stays offline, no-write and
 * byte-identical to the native-only pipeline. Unknown provider ids are
 * rejected by the schema itself (an unknown request is invalid configuration,
 * an operational error, §16.3 — never a silently ignored key); requesting a
 * provider whose adapter is not delivered (or is gated, like SonarJS §16.7)
 * is *valid* configuration and resolves to located `unsupported` evidence.
 *
 * Loading/discovery of the config file itself lives in `src/config/load.ts`
 * (trellis-6003); this module defines only the contract.

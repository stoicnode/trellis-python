/**
 * Contract version constants (SPEC §3.5, §6).
 *
 * Three versions travel with every report:
 *
 * - **Analyzer version** — the trellis release that produced the measurements;
 *   aliased from the package `VERSION` so the two can never drift apart.
 * - **Scoring version** — the provisional-formula version (SPEC §7). The
 *   formula itself lands with trellis-00d5; the constant is pinned here so
 *   reports already carry a stable value, and any recalibration bumps it
 *   together with its test expectations.
 * - **Schema version** — the report/configuration contract version (§6). One
 *   version covers the whole §6 contract family (metrics, findings,
 *   safeguards, coverage, report, configuration); any breaking contract
 *   change bumps it.
 *
 * Version-aware reading (SPEC §16.6, trellis-a24d): this trellis reads every
 * version in {@link SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSIONS} and no others. Each version
 * keeps its own interpretation — a pre-provider report (1.0.0) never reads
 * as carrying provider provenance — and an unknown or newer-incompatible
 * version fails actionably instead of loading with guessed semantics.

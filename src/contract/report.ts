/**
 * Audit report contract (SPEC §6.4, §16.6 — trellis-a24d).
 *
 * The report carries the three §3.5 versions, source coverage, the rolled-up
 * completeness state, raw metrics (separate from score contributions), the
 * 0–100 sloppiness index (lower is better — never a percentage of bad code),
 * deterministically ordered findings, and safeguard evidence (never folded
 * into the score). Since schema `1.1.0` it also carries the **per-analysis
 * evidence area** (§6.6): every measured analysis's provenance/status plus
 * the declarations that keep completeness honest.
 *
 * Cross-field honesty invariants enforced here (SPEC §3.4, §6 intro, §16.2):
 *
 * - `completeness` must equal the rollup of metric states — a report with an
 *   `incomplete` metric can never claim to look `complete`. Provider states
 *   never roll into this native rollup (§16.2).
 * - Every score contribution must trace to metrics present on the report
 *   (§7: every point is traceable) — and, on evidence-carrying reports, to
 *   a **scored** analysis: advisory evidence never enters the score (§16.5).
 * - `metrics` map keys must equal the carried metric `id`s.
 *
 * Version-aware reading (§16.6): the contract is a discriminated union on
 * `schemaVersion`. Each supported version keeps its own interpretation:
 *
 * - **1.0.0 (pre-provider)** — the original report: no evidence area (a
 *   report claiming one is rejected, never relabeled), and `score.partial`
 *   is true exactly when the metric-state rollup is `incomplete`.
 * - **1.1.0 (evidence-carrying)** — overall evidence completeness
 *   (`evidence.completeness`, rolled up from the carried analyses and the
 *   metric states) is **independent** from score completeness
 *   (`score.partial`, computed only from the declared scored inputs): an
 *   incomplete advisory analysis makes the evidence incomplete without
 *   flipping a complete native score, and a scored prerequisite's failure
 *   still marks the score partial.
 *
 * - **1.2.0 (scoped hotspots)** — requires explicit identified/ambiguous
 *   identity on native hotspots; all evidence/score rules remain unchanged.
 *
 * Unknown or newer-incompatible schema versions fail at the discriminator
 * with the supported versions named, instead of loading with guessed
 * semantics.
 *
 * Determinism (SPEC §3.5): the measurement payload excludes run metadata
 * (`run.auditedAt`, `run.durationMs`) from equality and fingerprint inputs —
 * use `measurementPayload` to obtain it.

/**
 * Fleet orchestration (SPEC §11, trellis-8366) — audit every target in a
 * loaded {@link Fleet} sequentially through the **same deterministic core** a
 * single-repo run uses, and assemble the aggregate {@link FleetReport}.
 *
 * Each target folds {@link runWorkspaceAudit} — the exact service the CLI's
 * `trellis audit` and the SDK's `audit()` call — so a fleet audit and an
 * independent core audit of the same workspace can never drift (the tests
 * prove the measurement payloads are deep-equal). The entry preserves the
 * target's whole §6.4 report (findings, completeness, metrics) plus the
 * declarative §9 policy assessment over the target's own configuration;
 * nothing is re-aggregated or re-scored at the fleet level.
 *
 * **Standards drift stays a separate capability (SPEC §11).** Each target
 * also runs {@link driftRepo} with its `canonical` options, and the per-state
 * counts ride along on the entry — but drift never enters the sloppiness
 * index, the policy assessment, or the fleet exit policy. A drift failure
 * (e.g. an unbundled canonical version) degrades to `driftError` on an
 * otherwise healthy entry; it never eats the audit.
 *
 * **Partial-failure isolation:** a target whose path is missing/unreadable,
 * or whose audit throws (e.g. an invalid `trellis.yaml`), becomes a
 * per-target error entry — the fleet keeps going and the surviving targets
 * still score. One bad repo never aborts the run.
 *
 * **Per-target provider scope (SPEC §16, plan `pl-43c5` step 20 —
 * trellis-f3e5).** Optional provider selection rides each target's own
 * configuration (the `providers` block of its `trellis.yaml` or explicit
 * `config`) through the same core service — the fleet holds no provider
 * logic, planning or policy of its own. Because every target folds its own
 * isolated `runWorkspaceAudit` call, nothing provider-related is shared
 * across targets: each request stages its own source view under trellis-owned
 * scratch (a fresh `mkdtemp` per analysis, cleaned on every exit path — a
 * neighbor's failure, unavailability or cleanup problem cannot touch it),
 * resolves its own pinned tool, and carries its own namespaced, unscored
 * evidence on its own report. A target that requests no provider stays
 * byte-identical to a native-only audit, and provider evidence never enters
 * the index, the summary counts or the exit rollup — mixed situations (one
 * target with complete evidence, one unavailable, one unrequested) stay
 * explicit per entry instead of being summed or averaged into anything
 * score-like. The fleet stays sequential (bounded concurrency of one, no
 * scheduling service): each target's staged-scratch lifecycle is fully
 * awaited inside its own audit before the next target starts, so two
 * targets can never share or race on a scratch path, and per-target
 * cancellation/cleanup semantics are exactly the single-audit core's.
 *
 * **Stateless by default (SPEC §8, §10).** Persistence is opt-in: with
 * `history` on, each target's run appends to the central audit history and
 * the entry carries the index move against the repo's previous compatible
 * run; without it the fleet opens no database.
 *
 * The orchestrator is surface-agnostic core: it takes an injectable audit
 * service, drift fn, path check, and clock so the whole flow runs offline
 * and deterministically in tests. `now` is pinned across the fleet so every
 * entry shares one `auditedAt`.
